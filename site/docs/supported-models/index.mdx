# Supported Models

:::info

Other models with similar architectures may also work successfully even if not explicitly validated.
Consider testing any unlisted models to verify compatibility with your specific use case.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

<LLMModelsTable />

:::info

LoRA adapters are supported.

::::info

The pipeline can work with other similar topologies produced by `optimum-intel` with the same model signature.
The model is required to have the following inputs after the conversion:

1. `input_ids` contains the tokens.
2. `attention_mask` is filled with `1`.
3. `beam_idx` selects beams.
4. `position_ids` (optional) encodes a position of currently generating token in the sequence and a single `logits` output.

:::note

Models should belong to the same family and have the same tokenizers.

## Visual Language Models (VLMs)

<VLMModelsTable />

:::warning VLM Models Notes
#### InternVL2 {#internvl2-notes}

To convert InternVL2 models, `timm` and `einops` are required:

```bash
pip install timm einops
```
#### phi3_v {#phi3_v-notes}
  - GPU isn't supported
  - Example models' configs aren't consistent. It's required to override the default `eos_token_id` with the one from a tokenizer:
    ```python
    generation_config.set_eos_token_id(pipe.get_tokenizer().get_eos_token_id())
    ```

## Speech Recognition Models (Whisper-based)

<WhisperModelsTable />

:::info

Some models may require access request submission on the Hugging Face page to be downloaded.

If https://huggingface.co/ is down, the conversion step won't be able to download the models.
