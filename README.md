GenAI contains pipelines that implement image and text generation tasks. The implementation exploits OpenVNIO capabilities to optimize the pipelines. Each sample covers a family of models and suggests that its implementation can be modified to adapt for a specific need.

Every pipeline requires https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino for C++ to be installed.
