            Title: Establishing Ground Truth in Fake News Detection: Methods and Challenges

            Abstract:
            The proliferation of misinformation on digital platforms has amplified the need for robust fake news detection systems. Central to developing and evaluating such systems is the establishment of a reliable ground truth. This paper reviews methodologies used to determine the veracity of news content, focusing on expert annotation, fact-checking services, and crowdsourcing. It also discusses challenges such as bias, subjectivity, and the evolving nature of truth in socio-political contexts.

            1. Introduction
            Fake news—deliberately false or misleading information presented as news—has become a global concern, impacting elections, public health, and societal trust. Machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques have emerged to detect fake news, but these systems require labeled datasets with a ground truth indicating whether content is true or false. Defining and verifying this ground truth is complex due to subjective interpretation, ideological bias, and temporal shifts in facts.

            2. Ground Truth Establishment Methods
            2.1 Expert Annotation
            Many datasets rely on professional journalists, domain experts, or researchers to manually annotate articles. Annotators verify claims against authoritative sources and follow defined guidelines to classify news as true, partially true, or false. This method ensures high-quality labels but is costly and time-consuming.
            2.2 Fact-Checking Organizations
            Ground truth is often derived from fact-checking platforms such as PolitiFact, Snopes, and FactCheck.org. These organizations apply rigorous verification processes and publish verdicts on individual claims. Datasets like LIAR and FakeNewsNet incorporate these verdicts as labels. While credible, such sources may still exhibit systemic biases based on their editorial standards.
            2.3 Crowdsourcing
            Some studies use non-expert crowdsourced workers to annotate news, leveraging redundancy and aggregation to improve label reliability. However, crowd workers may lack the domain knowledge or context needed to accurately judge factual correctness, leading to inconsistent labels.
            2.4 Source Credibility and Heuristics
            In some automated settings, the credibility of the news source is used as a proxy for truth. For example, mainstream media might be labeled as reliable, while fringe websites are flagged as less trustworthy. This approach is scalable but oversimplifies the nuanced nature of fake news.

            3. Challenges and Limitations
            Bias and Subjectivity: Annotator beliefs and the framing of news can influence labeling decisions.
            Temporal Dynamics: What is false today might become true tomorrow, and vice versa, particularly in fast-evolving domains like science or politics.
            Lack of Consensus: Multiple fact-checkers may disagree on the same piece of content.
            Granularity of Labels: Truth is often not binary; claims can be partially true or require additional context.

            4. Conclusion
            Establishing ground truth for fake news remains a critical and non-trivial task. Despite the availability of expert fact-checking and annotation methodologies, challenges such as bias, subjectivity, and the dynamic nature of truth persist. Future work should focus on consensus-building, context-aware labeling, and hybrid annotation pipelines combining expert and crowd-based approaches.

            Passage 1:
            Brown v. Board of Education
            Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the Court declared state laws establishing separate public schools for black and white students to be unconstitutional. The decision overturned the "separate but equal" doctrine established by Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 and helped dismantle racial segregation across the United States.

            Background
            The case was a consolidation of five different cases all challenging the constitutionality of racial segregation in public schools. African American students had been denied admission to certain public schools based on laws allowing segregation by race. The lead plaintiff, Oliver Brown, filed suit against the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, after his daughter was denied entry to an all-white school near their home.

            Decision
            The Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice Earl Warren, unanimously ruled that "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal," violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ruling mandated the desegregation of schools across America, though implementation met with resistance and took many years.

            Passage 2:
            Roe v. Wade
            Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was a landmark decision of the United States Supreme Court in which the Court ruled that a state law that banned abortions except to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The ruling effectively legalized abortion nationwide and ignited decades of political and legal debate.

            Background
            The case was brought by "Jane Roe" (a pseudonym for Norma McCorvey), who challenged the Texas law criminalizing most abortions. Roe argued that the law violated her constitutional rights. The case was heard during the 1971-1972 term and decided in 1973.

            Decision
            The Court held that a woman's right to privacy included the decision to have an abortion but balanced this against the state's interests in regulating abortions and protecting prenatal life. The ruling created a trimester framework limiting state intervention early in pregnancy.

            Question: Which case was decided first, Brown v. Board of Education or Roe v. Wade?

            Liam had never known the bustling comfort of a large household. From the earliest days he could recall, the modest cottage at the edge of Ashwood village had been his only home. The worn wooden door, its paint peeling from years of rain and sun, opened to a small sitting room where the scent of old books mingled with the faint aroma of lavender and fresh bread. This humble abode belonged to his grandmother, a stern yet kind woman whose hands told stories of decades spent in toil and tender care.
            
            Though the cottage was simple—furnished with a creaking oak table, a patchwork quilt upon the narrow bed, and shelves lined with knickknacks collected through the years—it held a quiet warmth that comforted Liam against the chill of the outside world. His parents, long gone, had entrusted him to her care when he was but a child, and since then, the two had forged a life marked by routine and resilience.
            
            Each morning, Liam awoke to the soft creak of his grandmother’s footsteps in the kitchen, where a pot of tea simmered and fresh bread awaited. Though the village was small and the neighbors few, Liam found solace in the steady rhythm of his days and the steadfast presence of the woman who had become both guardian and guide. It was a life shaped less by abundance and more by the quiet strength of kinship and simple comforts.
            Question:  What is Liam's living situation?

            Answer the following question based on the above text, only give me the answer and do not output any other words.
            
            The room was dimly lit by the fading afternoon sun filtering through the lace curtains, casting delicate shadows upon the worn velvet armchair where Clara sat, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of a handkerchief. Outside, the garden lay silent, the rose bushes heavy with dew and the faint hum of bees long departed. The grandfather clock in the hallway chimed softly, marking the hour with a slow, measured toll that seemed to echo the heaviness in the air. Though her lips formed a faint smile, her eyes betrayed a restless uncertainty that no outward calm could conceal.
            
            “You must understand,” she murmured, “that it is not simply a matter of choice, but of circumstance. My father’s debts have weighed heavily upon us, and the suitor’s offer is, for all its faults, a promise of security.” She glanced briefly at the portrait of her late mother, whose serene expression seemed to judge the scene before her with silent disappointment. Her companion nodded slowly, sensing the storm beneath her calm exterior. He shifted in his chair, the worn leather creaking faintly, and gestured toward the heavy oak bookcase lined with dusty volumes—tales of adventure and lost fortunes that seemed strangely out of place in this somber moment.
            
            “And yet,” he said softly, “do you truly wish to accept such a fate?” The question hung in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender and the distant tolling of church bells. Clara’s fingers tightened around the handkerchief as she weighed the promise of safety against the shadow of resignation that it cast. Outside, the sky deepened into twilight, and a single star began to twinkle, indifferent to the choices that troubled the heart within.
            
            Question: What is Clara’s primary concern about her suitor’s offer?

            Answer the question based on the given passages.
            Passage 1:
            Isabella of France
            Isabella of France (1295–1358), daughter of King Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre, ascended to the position of queen consort of England through her politically motivated union with King Edward II. This marriage, orchestrated amidst complex Franco-English relations, was intended to fortify a fragile peace between the two kingdoms. Isabella's legacy is notably marked by her instrumental role in the eventual deposition of her husband, an act that earned her the sobriquet "She-Wolf of France," reflecting both her formidable political resolve and the controversy surrounding her ambitions within the English court.
            
            Passage 2:
            Margaret Cavendish
            Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne (1623–1673), born Margaret Lucas into a family of modest noble standing, emerged as an extraordinarily prolific writer, philosopher, and natural scientist during a period when such pursuits were rarely encouraged among women of her rank. Her marriage to William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle, granted her access to intellectual circles where she produced an extensive oeuvre encompassing poetry, theatrical works, and philosophical treatises. Despite facing societal skepticism and critique, her unconventional perspectives challenged prevailing norms on gender and scientific inquiry, making her a singular figure in seventeenth-century English letters.
            
            Passage 3:
            Anne Boleyn
            Anne Boleyn (c. 1501–1536), scion of the English nobility and daughter of Thomas Boleyn, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond, and Lady Elizabeth Howard, spent her formative years partially abroad in the courts of the Netherlands and France, an experience that shaped her cultural sophistication and political acumen. Her eventual marriage to King Henry VIII was fraught with religious and political upheaval, catalyzing the English Reformation and the severance from papal authority. Anne's tragic downfall, culminating in charges of treason, adultery, and incest—charges historians continue to scrutinize—sealed her fate and profoundly altered the course of English history.
            
            Question: From which region or court did the wife of King Henry VIII originate during her youth?

            Passage:
            The History and Influence of Impressionism
            
            Impressionism, emerging in the late 19th century, was a revolutionary art movement that challenged traditional academic painting in France. Its pioneers, including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro, emphasized capturing the transient effects of light and color rather than meticulous detail. The movement’s name derives from Monet’s painting Impression, Sunrise exhibited in 1874, which critics initially mocked but later embraced as emblematic of a new artistic vision.
            
            The Impressionists frequently painted en plein air (outdoors), striving to portray scenes of modern life, landscapes, and fleeting moments with loose brushwork and vibrant palettes. Their approach broke away from the somber tones and historical subjects favored by the Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.
            
            Despite early criticism and rejection by traditional art institutions, Impressionism profoundly influenced subsequent movements like Post-Impressionism and Fauvism. Moreover, it democratized art by focusing on everyday subjects and ordinary people rather than aristocratic or mythological themes.
            
            Beyond painting, Impressionism’s impact extended into literature and music, inspiring writers such as Marcel Proust and composers like Claude Debussy, who echoed its emphasis on atmosphere and mood.

            The Rise and Global Impact of Streaming Services on the Film Industry
            
            In the early 21st century, streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and later Disney+, fundamentally transformed the film and television industry. Initially starting as a DVD-by-mail service, Netflix pivoted to streaming in 2007, leading a digital revolution that disrupted the traditional distribution models of cinema and broadcast television.
            
            One of the most significant shifts caused by streaming has been the collapse of the theatrical release window. Previously, films would debut exclusively in cinemas for months before becoming available for home viewing. Streaming services, however, began offering original films directly to subscribers, sometimes releasing them simultaneously in theaters and online—most notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated this trend.
            
            This shift has sparked debates across the industry. While some filmmakers argue that streaming democratizes access and offers greater creative freedom, others worry it diminishes the cultural experience of cinema and undermines box office revenue. Additionally, streaming platforms use complex algorithms to personalize recommendations, influencing viewer habits and even greenlighting content based on data-driven predictions rather than purely artistic vision.
            
            Globally, the reach of streaming has enabled regional and independent films to gain international exposure. Korean dramas, Spanish thrillers, and Indian series now enjoy mainstream success beyond their borders, contributing to a diversification of storytelling and audience tastes worldwide.

            Paragraph 1: In 2005, Sega partnered with Atmos Tokyo to produce sports-themed iDogs as part of a new line, titled "iDog x Atmos". In 2007, Tiger Electronics released the iDog Amp'd, an upgraded version of the iDog with stereo speakers that nod its head and tap its foot in time with the music being played.  The iDog Pup, a puppy version of the iDog with poseable ears and a moving head, was released in 2007 and was a localized version of the iDog Mini released in Japan in 2005. Also in 2007, two variants called "SpiDogs" were released to promote the film Spider-Man 3. They resemble the standard Spider-Man costume and the Black Suit respectively. In 2008, three new versions of the iDog were released. The iDog Clip is a fully functional mini-sized iDog which can be clipped onto a backpack, the iDog Dance is a larger version of the iDog that stands up and dances in time to the music, it also features 7 touch sensors (like the iCat), and the iDog Soft Speaker, a plush version of the iDog Amp'd that remixes some songs on it and has a pocket where the battery compartment is so you can store things in it. In 2009, as one of the last iDogs released, Hasbro released the iDog Plush Puppy. This smaller plush iDog came in pink and purple and was one of the first iDogs that didn't need batteries. It came with a cord attached to it, like the iDog Clip. But it had the light patterns stitched onto it.
            
            Paragraph 2:
            The iDog Clip, introduced in 2008, was a compact version of the original iDog that users could attach to backpacks or clothing. Despite its smaller size, it retained the full functionality of the larger models and responded to music and touch input. It proved especially popular among younger children due to its portability and playful design.
            
            Paragraph 3:
            The Colossal Kongs, a tag team consisting of "King Kong" and "Awesome Kong", were active in the early 1990s. They performed in multiple wrestling promotions, including WCW and the Global Wrestling Federation. Though they never captured a major championship, they were known for their size and theatrics.
            
            Paragraph 4:

It proved especially popular among younger children due to its portability and playful design.
            
            Paragraph 5:
            In 1993, the wrestling team of King Kong and Awesome Kong made their WCW debut. Managed by Harley Race, they participated in notable events such as Clash of the Champions XXIV and Starrcade. Although they did not win, their large frames and masked appearances gained attention.

            Here are 5 paragraphs from Wikipedia, along with an abstract. Please determine which paragraph the abstract is from.
            
            Paragraph 1:
            In 1986, the Soviet Union launched the Mir space station, which became one of the most ambitious long-duration human spaceflight projects of the 20th century. It consisted of a core module and later added several research modules developed by various Soviet research institutes. The station hosted over 100 different people from 12 countries, including collaborative missions with the United States under the Shuttle-Mir program. Mir remained in orbit for 15 years before being deorbited in 2001. Its legacy influenced the design and international cooperation model used for the International Space Station.
            
            Paragraph 2:
            Ada Lovelace is often regarded as the first computer programmer due to her work on Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine. In 1843, she translated an Italian article about the Engine and added a comprehensive set of notes, including a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers—considered the first algorithm intended for a machine. Her visionary understanding of the machine’s capabilities went beyond mere calculation, suggesting it could manipulate symbols and create music. Her contributions were largely unrecognized during her lifetime but gained prominence in the late 20th century.
            
            Paragraph 3:
            The Great Fire of London in 1666 was a catastrophic event that destroyed a large part of the city, including 87 churches and around 13,000 houses. Starting in a bakery on Pudding Lane, the fire spread rapidly due to strong winds and the use of timber in construction. Although only six deaths were officially recorded, it is believed the real number was higher. The fire led to major changes in building regulations and urban planning, with notable efforts led by Christopher Wren to redesign London’s skyline.
            
            Paragraph 4:
            The Galápagos Islands, located off the coast of Ecuador, are famous for their unique biodiversity and significant influence on Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution. The archipelago consists of 13 main islands and several smaller ones, each hosting distinct ecosystems. Species like the marine iguana, Galápagos tortoise, and finches exhibit striking adaptations. Strict conservation policies are now in place due to the islands’ ecological importance and vulnerability to tourism and climate change.
            
            Paragraph 5:
            Marie Curie remains one of the most celebrated scientists in history. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the only person to win in two different scientific fields: Physics and Chemistry. Alongside her husband Pierre, she discovered the elements polonium and radium, which led to the development of radiotherapy for cancer. Curie’s research was groundbreaking but exposed her to high levels of radiation, which eventually led to her death. Her notebooks are still radioactive today.
            
            Abstract:
            This passage details a historic urban disaster that began in a bakery and rapidly consumed thousands of homes and many churches. It significantly reshaped the city’s physical structure and prompted major urban planning reforms, spearheaded by a well-known architect.

            Passage 1:
            We probably all saw this coming, given that this was one of the biggest media stories of the last week — Saturday Night LIve opened the show with a comment from Rush Limbaugh on the fallout from his remarks about Georgetown student Sandra Fluke. Up and coming cast MVP Taran Killam played the cranky radio host, who chastised the “sluts” at Turbo Tax and other sponsors for deserting him after his unpopular rants about birth control. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The sketch was amusing in its dedication to coming up with bizarre sponsors for Limbaugh’s show (“Depends For Racists,” anyone?) but even Killam’s shouty, dedicated delivery couldn’t distract from the reality that the sketch was the same joke repeated about twenty times, making it feel longer than Rush’s actual show. HEY-O! “There could be a nuclear apocalypse, and I would still be right here calling the cockroaches sluts.” I’m sure that’s true, Rush, but luckily we didn’t have to stick around to see it — that was the sign off for the sketch. You can see the cold open below, via NBC: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com
            Passage 2:
            March 10, 2012 10:54 am ET by MMFA Staff NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Radio-Info.com reported on Friday that 98 advertisers have told Premiere Radio Networks, which syndicates Rush Limbaugh's radio show, that they want to avoid advertising on Limbaugh's show and other programs with content "deemed to be offensive or controversial": NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The list includes carmakers (Ford, GM, Toyota), insurance companies (Allstate, Geico, Prudential, State Farm) and restaurants (McDonald's, Subway). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The advertisers were reportedly included in a Premiere memo circulated to radio station traffic managers and obtained by Radio-Info.com, laying out the growing reach of the advertiser exodus, which has now ensnared other controversial radio hosts: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR They've specifically asked that you schedule their commercials in dayparts or programs free of content that you know are deemed to be offensive or controversial (for example, Mark Levin, Rush Limbaugh, Tom Leykis, Michael Savage, Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity). Those are defined as environments likely to stir negative sentiment from a very small percentage of the listening public. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Advertisers have dropped their ads from Limbaugh's show in the wake of his misogynistic attacks on Sandra Fluke. The online feed at WABC, Limbaugh's flagship station, has increasingly turned to free public service announcements during Limbaugh's show.

            Passage 2:
            The London School of Economics is investigating allegations that a Nazi-themed drinking game led to a brawl in which a Jewish student's nose was broken. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The inquiry relates to a skiing trip to Val d'Isère organised by the students' union last month and attended by 150 students from the university's athletics union. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to a statement released by the LSE's Jewish society, the assault took place after a Jewish student objected to the drinking game. The violence was not serious enough for French police to be involved, a students' union source said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The LSE said: "These are disturbing allegations relating to events which took place on a foreign trip organised by the students' union. Both the SU and LSE are investigating these events and are prepared to take disciplinary action if the allegations are shown to be true. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "Students must abide by clear standards of behaviour set by both LSE and the SU and breaches of those standards are taken very seriously. We do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of racism." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to the LSE's student newspaper, the Beaver, the game played was a Nazi-themed version of the drinking game Ring of Fire. This involved playing cards being arranged on a table in the shape of a swastika. Players were required to "salute the Führer", the paper said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jay Stoll, president of the LSE's Jewish Society, said: "Nazi glorification and antisemitism have no place in our universities, which should remain safe spaces for all students. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "There is simply no context for what has happened here. Those who believe the game was all in good humour need to realise that when a Jewish student is subject to violence and the Nazi ideology glorified it is no joke but a spiteful, collective attack on a community." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Jewish student who suffered the injury told the Guardian: "I've seen this kind of game before, so it wasn't so much the game that offended me, as much as the antisemitic gibes that went with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "There was a mix of personal references and general Jewish insults. That was after I excused myself from the game. It made me extremely upset. That was the tipping point for me. It was a build-up during the game, and seeing the swastika obviously, but the comments built up to the point where I couldn't forgive myself if I let it slide. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "I feel angry about it now. There's no doubt it was an affront at my identity, but on a personal level it was extremely upsetting." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Alex Peters-Day, general secretary of the students' union, said: "This is so at odds with everything the LSE and the union stand for". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Most of the students at the university, founded by socialists Beatrice and Sidney Webb, are from overseas. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brendan Mycock, president of the LSE athletics union, condemned what he said were the actions of "a small group of individuals". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR "The athletics union prides itself on our open and tolerant nature and behaviour of this sort is not acceptable and is not an accurate representation of the behaviour we uphold ourselves to. Being in the athletics union is about being a team, behaving with respect to our team-mates and athletics union peers and representing our union and our university." NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Last November the Daily Telegraph reported claims that members of the Oxford University Conservative Association regularly sang an antisemitic song with Nazi references.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Cobain’s daughter with Courtney Love, Frances Bean Cobain, has been trying to get the instrument — which her father played in Nirvana’s seminal 1993 “MTV Unplugged” concert — back from her estranged husband, Isaiah Silva, ever since they split in March 2016. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Silva, a musician in the band the Eeries, claims that in happier times, Frances Bean gave him the guitar — a Martin D-18E with the bridge flipped so that Kurt could play it left-handed — as a wedding present when they secretly married in 2014. It was once insured for $1 million, but experts say it is now likely worth several times that amount. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Frances Bean, who was not yet 2 years old when her father committed suicide in 1994, denies that she gifted it to Silva. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Love has said of the guitar — believed to be the last Kurt played before his death — “It’s not [Silva’s]. It’s a treasured heirloom of the family. It’s not his to take.” NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The guitar is so valuable that Love’s manager has even allegedly sent a string of threatening messages to Silva’s ex-girlfriend in an attempt to get him to hand the historic instrument over. We’re told that after months of negotiation, Silva is still holding out and — according to Frances Bean’s side — is taking “extreme and unsupportable positions” on the disagreement.

            张家口市桥东区人民检察院以张东检一部刑诉（2019）1号起诉书指控被告人王海江犯诈骗罪，于2020年1月16日向本院提起公诉。本院受理后，依法组成合议庭并适用普通程序，公开开庭审理了本案。张家口市桥东区人民检察院指派检察员闫鑫出庭支持公诉，被告人王海江到庭参加诉讼。因受新冠疫情影响，本案于2020年2月6日中止诉讼，2020年7月9日恢复审理，现已审理终结。
            张家口市桥东区人民检察院起诉书指控：2019年5月至2019年7月，被告人王海江因无法偿还被害人张某的债务，虚构“高乐”、“赵佳”、“刘律师”、“胡建国”，并以上述人员的名义和被害人张某通过微信联系，谎称“高乐”、“赵佳”欠王海江钱，“高乐”、“赵佳”同意替王海江偿还欠张某的债务，“高乐”名下的一对公账户中有20余万元，但该对公账户被冻结，需要通过刷银行流水解封对公账户，只要解封冻结账户便可以偿还王海江欠张某的债务。被害人张某信以为真，为解封账户，索要欠款，共向被告人汇款1802100元。被告人将大部分赃款用于网络赌博及个人消费。被告人到案后自愿认罪认罚。
            公诉机关就上述指控提供了：手机，受案登记表、立案决定书，抓获经过，银行流水，微信账单，手机号户主查询记录，亚鑫彩印工商信息，建行对公账户管理规定，办案说明，证人李某、陈某的证言，被害人张某的陈述，被告人王海江的供述与辩解，辨认笔录，收集数据恢复报告等证据。
            公诉机关认为，被告人王海江以非法占有为目的，虚构事实、隐瞒真相，骗取被害人张某人民币1802100元，数额特别巨大，其行为触犯了《中华人民共和国刑法》第二百六十六条之规定，犯罪事实清楚，证据确实、充分，应当以诈骗罪追究其刑事责任。被告人自愿认罪认罚，对犯罪事实如实供述，建议判处被告人有期徒刑十一年，并处罚金。提起公诉，请依法判处。
            被告人王海江对公诉机关的指控无异议，当庭自愿认罪，但辩解手机微信恢复的数据证实自己有中止犯罪的行为，张某给转钱时候都有实名认证，他应该知道都是给自己打钱。
            经审理查明，2019年5月至2019年7月间，被告人王海江因无法偿还被害人张某的债务，虚构“高乐”、“赵佳”、“刘律师”、“胡建国”，并以上述人员的名义与被害人张某通过微信联系，谎称“高乐”、“赵佳”欠王海江钱，“高乐”、“赵佳”同意替王海江偿还欠张某的债务。王海江编造“高乐”名下的一个对公账户中有20余万元被冻结，需要通过刷银行流水解封对公账户，只要解除冻结，便可以偿还王海江欠张某债务的事实，骗取被害人信任。被害人张某为解封账户，索要欠款，共向被告人汇款1802100元。被告人将170余万元转付蒙扁立、农进军用于网络赌博，其余用于个人消费。2019年8月12日王海江被抓获。王海江到案后如实供述上述犯罪事实。
            在审查起诉阶段，被告人王海江就指控的其犯诈骗罪签署认罪认罚具结书，同意公诉机关指控本人的罪名及有期徒刑十一年并处罚金的量刑建议。公诉机关出具量刑建议书建议判处被告人有期徒刑十一年，并处罚金。

            安土桃山时代
            安土桃山时代又称织丰时代（1573年-1603年），织田信长与丰臣秀吉称霸日本的时代。以织田信长的本城安土城和丰臣秀吉的本城桃山城（又称“伏见城”）为名。历时30年。上承室町时代，下启江户时代。也把1467年的应仁之乱到1615年大阪之阵，包括安土桃山时代在内称为广义的战国时代。时代特征是由战国时代的分裂走向丰臣、德川时代的统一，伴随着现代化趋势。安土桃山时代日本出现了强大的军事领导者。他们击败了相互作战的诸大名，并且统一了日本。这个时代三个主要人物相继成为这个时期的主导者：织田信长（1573年至1582年）、丰臣秀吉（1582年至1598年）、德川家康（1598年至1615年）。三个主要人物持续统治了这个时期，织田信长，丰臣秀吉和德川家康。他们作为主要领主出现，并统率着大量的军队。随着他们实力的增长，他们都向京都的宫廷寻求支持。织田信长在1571年凭借装备精良的正规军击败了天台宗的僧兵，并且烧掉了日本中世纪的标志——佛教圣山、天台宗的大本营比睿山，还杀死了数千的僧侣。1573年，放逐了室町幕府末代将军足利义昭，开创了历史上的安土桃山时期。织田平定了大半个日本，秀吉继之统一天下，后丰臣氏被德川氏取代。织田信长和丰臣秀吉进行了许多先进的为政举措，推动了日本的现代化。
            安土桃山时代历史：安土时代 应仁之乱后，日本各地大名纷纷崛起，战火纷飞，民不聊生。16世纪中叶，一位决心以武力统一日本、结束乱世的枭雄出现，他就是织田信长。永禄三年（1560年），织田信长在桶狭间以两千人马击败今川义元二万五千大军，名声大振。1567年，消灭斋藤并迁都于其本城稻叶山，改名岐阜，从此天下布武。1568年，占领日本首都京都（日语把这一行动称为上洛）。之后统一近畿，并准备进攻山阴、山阳。在此期间，信长修筑了气势宏大、壮丽明快的安土城。因此，信长的时代被称为“安土时代”。 [2] 织田信长在清州（现日本名古屋地区）时推行军事改革，实行“民兵分离”政策，在还处于农业为主的日本有了一支长期稳定的军事力量，从而军事实力迅速强大起来。与此同时美浓地区的斋藤家（在织田信长主政织田家时期，斋藤家与织田家是亲家，即同盟关系）日渐衰落，在”斋藤三老“和竹中半兵卫相继背叛斋藤家转而投靠织田家后，织田信长发动了对斋藤家的战争，占领了斋藤家的居城稻叶山城。后经扩建，织田信长将新城取名”岐阜“（取周文王起于岐山（凤鸣岐山）和孔子之乡曲阜之意）。同时织田信长宣称“天下布武”，表明了武力统一天下的决心。之后，他又趁着正亲町天皇和足利将军请他帮助恢复他们在尾张的领地和权力的时候，取得了统一全国的合法地位。1568年9月，织田信长占据京都，扶立足利义昭为将军，并控制了天皇，挟天子以令诸侯，加快了他统一全国的步伐。 在这些主要步骤之后，他通过大规模的战争控制了大约三分之一的日本。 安土桃山时代大名联盟 织田信长 1560年，全国最强守护大名今川义元试图进攻京都，但1560年5月在桶狭间之战被信长击败战死。信长得到了天皇的支持，并在将军的继位斗争中安置了他自己的候选人。军队撤退后，信长已然控制了幕府。在京都地区，最初的抵抗来自于佛教徒、敌对的大名和敌对的商人。为了摆脱敌人的包围，信长在1571年首先以世俗的力量击败了富有战斗性的天台宗僧人，并且破坏了他们在京都附近的的修道中心比睿山，还杀死了数千的僧侣。1573年，他战胜了当地的大名，放逐了最后一个足利将军，开创了历史上的安土桃山时期。这个时期以信长和秀吉的城堡命名。在这些主要步骤之后，信长在琵琶湖畔的安土建造了七层的，用石头墙壁围着的城堡。城堡可以承受火枪的打击，成为战国时期的标志。信长授予被征服大名封地，清除免税商业的障碍，把受贬抑的宗教团体和商人拉拢到他自己的军事体系中，因此增长了自己的实力。他通过大规模的战争控制了大约三分之一的省，还设立并实施了一系列的行政管理制度，例如系统的村庄组织，税收和标准化的量度。同时，其他的大名包括已经被信长征服的和他控制之外的，也建造了他们自己的极其坚固的城堡并使他们的驻军现代化。1577年，信长派他的主要战将，秀吉去攻占西本州的十二个省。这场战争拖延了。1582年，当信长带领军队支援秀吉的时候，被手下武将明智光秀谋反杀害。在消灭了明智光秀之后，秀吉成为信长未成年长孙（织田秀信，幼名三法师）的保护者之一。1584年，秀吉消灭了柴田胜家，逼迫织田信长三子织田信孝自杀，并迫使信长次子织田信雄投降，完全控制了京都，成为信长无可争议的继承人。秀吉生来就是没有姓氏的农民，他被藤原家收为养子，被赐姓丰臣，成为贵族，并得到了关白的职位。这意味着全日本的内政和军事都为他所控制。之后的一年中，他维持了与九个主要大名中三个的同盟，并继续在四国和北九州的战争。1590年，秀吉动用20万军队，战胜了控制东本州关东地区的最后一个敌手。剩下的大名都投降了，日本战国时代的战争就结束了。秀吉独裁控制全日本，通过直接的手段或是盟誓的陪臣。新的中央政府体系开始运作。国家被一个大名联盟统一了，但是还是分散化的。 丰臣秀吉是日本战国时期最出类拔萃的历史人物。织田信长，丰臣秀吉在进行统一日本伟大事业过程中所开辟的安土桃山时代成为日本历史中最辉煌灿烂的时代。 [2] 安土桃山时代大乱求治 十五世纪，日本在室町幕府统治时期发生了应仁之乱。各地方的守护大名为扩大自己的势力范围进行着战争，室町幕府的中央统治名存实亡。在全国性的割据战争中，许多守护大名灭亡了，同时，又有许多武士崛起成为战国大名。到了十六世纪，这种情形愈演愈烈，成为燎原之势。在这些新崛起的战国大名中，又以毛利元就和斋藤道三为突出。毛利元就原来是依附于统治日本中国地方的大诸侯大内氏的武士，社会地位低，但是机谋超群，又极具野心。当大内义隆受到家臣陶晴贤的反叛而被谋害时，毛利元就抓住时机出兵攻击远比自己强大的陶晴贤。在消灭陶晴贤的过程中，大大的扩展了自己的势力范围，进而控制了几乎整个中国地方，成为威震日本诸岛的霸主。 斋藤道三原名长井规秀，是一个卖油郎。此人智谋过人，具有雄才大略。他侍奉美侬国（今歧阜县）守护大名土歧氏。1542年春。他突然起兵发动兵变，驱逐了家主土歧赖艺，自领美侬国战国大名。 在原有的守护大名中，也不乏佼佼者。甲信地区的甲斐国（今山梨县）一直由武田氏世领。其大名武田信虎的长子武田信玄起兵驱逐了父亲并取而代之。随后，武田信玄东征西讨，雄霸信浓，成为甲斐之虎。此外，越后的上杉氏、关东的后北条氏、东海道的今川氏、九州地区的岛津氏以及四国地区的长宗我部氏也有出色的表现。 在尾张国（今爱知县），在十六世纪中叶，出现了一位出色的英雄，他就是向来被人非议的“尾张大傻瓜”织田信长。1548年，织田信长继承父业成为织田家主。此时，他的势力极其弱小，没有人会在意他。但是。美侬国的大名斋藤道三独具慧眼，断定信长必成霸业。1556年，他把女儿斋藤归蝶嫁给了信长，并要把领下的美侬国作为嫁妆。其子斋藤义龙对此十分不满，杀害了自己的父亲，成为家主，并与信长为敌。 1560年春，控制了骏河、远江、三河三国的大诸侯今川义元经过充分准备后，集中了大批军队向毗邻的尾张国发动了战争，并势不可挡地连克尾张数城，兵临尾张国居城清州城（今名古屋市）下，企图打开进军京都的通道。当时，织田信长势单力薄，灭亡只是瞬息间的事，就连他的部将也认为无力回天。但是，奇迹在织田信长手上发生了。5月17日深夜，织田信长单骑率几百名亲兵冒雨突向正在桶狭间休息的今川义元大军，斩下了武勇无双免得今川义元的首级。信长的部将们闻讯纷纷赶来助战，一夜之间，3000人的信长军队全歼了来犯的25000人今川军队。“桶狭间会战”改写了日本历史，它把织田信长推向了历史的前台。 1562年，在今川家为人质的松平家家主松平元康（即德川家康）乘今川氏桶狭间会战失败后元气大伤之际，在三河国冈崎城（今爱知县）独立。织田信长与德川家康结盟，命家康抵御武田信玄的扩张，开始了北伐美侬国，为岳父报仇的征程。 “墨俣筑城”是织田信长从尾张开始向外发展的一个具有战略意义的事件。这个事件的主角就是丰臣秀吉。

            淨土法門，實為十方三世一切諸佛，上成佛道、下化眾生之通規，亦為末法時代一切眾生，仗佛慈力，即生了脫之要道。良以如來所說一切法門，無非令眾生出生死、成佛道耳；但以上根者少，中下者多，故能於即生了脫者，雖在正像，尚不多見，況末法人根陋劣、壽命短 促、知識希少、邪外縱橫之時乎？
            由是如來預鑒機宜，特開淨土一門，俾一切若聖若凡、上中下根，同事修持，同於現在往生淨土。上根則速成佛道，下根則亦預聖流，較彼一代所說仗自力法門，下手易而成功高，用力少而得效速，以佛力法力，不可思議；加以眾生信願行力，則無論功夫淺深、罪業輕重， 皆得蒙佛慈力，接引往生也。
            以故如來于諸大乘經，咸皆帶說。如華嚴、法華、楞嚴等。其專說者。則有《阿彌陀經》、《無量壽經》、《觀無量壽佛經》。此三經中，凡彌陀之誓願、淨土之莊嚴、三輩九品之生因、十方諸佛之讚歎，悉皆顯示無遺。而《阿彌陀經》言簡義周，最易受持。由是古人列為 日課，無論若宗若教若律，皆于暮時讀誦。是舉天下之若僧若俗，無不以淨土為歸者。然雖如是行持，若不諦審佛祖立法之所以然者，猶然不以求生西方為事。殆所謂『日用不知，習矣不察』者乎？即通宗通教之高人，尚多崇尚自力法門，不肯仰仗佛力。其志固高，其事實 難?生做到。倘惑業未能淨盡，再一受生，多半迷失；不但所期皆成畫餅，且有因福造業、後生墮落之虞。由是言之，誠堪畏懼。
            須知淨土法門，為一代時教中之特別法門，不可以與通途法門並論。若不明此義，以仗自力通途法門之義，疑仗佛力特別法門之益，而不肯信受，則其失大矣！佛說難信，蓋即指此。若無此執，則誰不信受奉行焉？近來世道人心，陷溺已極，無可救藥。凡有具正知見之偉人 傑士，莫不以提倡因果報應、生死輪回，為挽回狂瀾之據。精修淨業，求生西方。為究竟安穩之法。一倡百和，無不率從。由是吃素念佛、改惡修善者，日見其多。
            所可惜者，普通善信。未嘗學問，雖日讀彌陀經，究不知所說者為何義；縱有疏鈔要解等注，亦非彼所能閱。黃智海居士，利人心切，取疏鈔要解之義，以白話解釋之，俾彼稍識字者，亦得了知經義。由是更加精進，竭誠修持，并以轉化有緣，則現生身心清淨，優入聖賢之 域；臨終感應道交，直登極樂之邦；其為利益，莫能名焉。爰書大義,，以貢閱者。

            阿彌陀經白話解釋序二　（諦閑法師序）
            佛以無上妙慧，觀一切眾生。知其根性大小不同，而以方便智、說方便法：為闡提人說十善；為小乘人說四諦；為中乘人說十二因緣；為大乘人說六波羅蜜。皆對病根，投以良藥。此蓋方便教中不易之典也。
            復以徹底大悲，鑒六道群機，識其道緣，淺深匪一，以殊勝異方便智，說殊勝異方便法：
            為上根人，說觀想念佛法，即《觀無量壽佛經》前十二觀皆是也；
            為中根人，說觀像念佛法，第十三觀是也；
            為下根人，說稱名念佛法；
            為最下根、業重障深人，說臨終十稱念佛，即得往生法，第十六觀是也。
            可見佛無棄人，唯人自棄耳。獨有《佛說阿彌陀經》之信願持名念佛，尤為方便之方便，殊勝之殊勝。
            須知持名有二種持法：
            一者「事持」，但將『阿彌陀佛』四字，驀直持去，持至一心不亂，臨終決定往生，即不可以中下根論。
            二者「理持」，正持名時，能知離心無佛、離佛無心，心佛不二，即是實相念佛。若加信願，臨終上品上生，非最上利根者不能。故知持名念佛，普被三根，無機不攝，至圓頓、最直捷。七日成功，片言即證；橫超三界，豎徹五時，誠為稀有難信之法門。故感六方諸佛，異 口同音，稱揚勸信。釋迦如來，四辯八音所親宣也。
            經中，初則詳陳依正莊嚴以啟信；中則特勸應求往生以發願；後則正示執持名號以立行。一經旨宗，唯信願行，義無餘蘊，文相昭然。嗚呼！時至末法，鈍根者多；五濁繁興，三災頻仍。而此經者，持誦固多，研詳實寡。雖有雲棲疏鈔、靈峰要解，類皆文言法語，自非初機 淺識人能得實益。
            上海黃子涵之，有鑒於斯，先以淺近苦切之詞，編成白話，說明兩土苦樂形容，俾知此土有三毒四倒、六道輪回之苦，而生厭離；彼國有七珍八德、九品蓮華之樂，而生忻慕。詳言彼方其國，無有三途八難、瓦礫泥砂，純以珍寶而為莊嚴；其人無有九惱十纏、死生老病，純 以聖賢而為眷屬。庶幾初機人修淨業者，知所趣向，遂命名曰《初機淨業指南》，出數千部書，風行海內，可謂煞費婆心矣。
            茲仍以淺近白話文字，取諸祖意，解釋此經，語甚夷易，事出常談。覽其詞，能識其心；識得心，不待境靜，而心自靜。不提心念，而佛自念。可謂大悲芬陀利、法炬陀羅尼，隨俗而即俗明真，變淨而以淨覆穢，若空穀之答響，洪鐘不待叩矣！
            噫！道本無言，非言不顯。且此經者，我佛不得已而言之也。言有不達，道無以明，是則前祖之疏解。亦不容其已也。言既高深，鈍根難入。今用白話文字，解釋佛經。又寧得而已之哉？
            予故知以白話之淺言，暢經中之深義；既甚便於初機，深有裨於法化，俾彼讀者，由淺而知深、即近而悟遠。因是書之言，而知疏解之言；因疏解之言，而悟佛經之言。佛言悟矣，信以之而真、願以之而切、持名念佛之行以之而相續不斷、求生極樂之心，可勇決矣。

            阿彌陀經白話解釋說明原因同了看的方法　(黃智海居士序)
            修行的方法很多，但是有些方法，不是我們這些根機淺薄的人，能夠做得到的。有些方法，做起來很難、很長久，恐怕等不到修成功，修行的心，已經退了；或是修還沒有修成功，人倒已經要死了。還有些方法，做起來，若是不十分明白裡頭的道理，往往就要著魔的，只有 這個念佛修到西方極樂世界去的方法，最是穩當，最是容易。
            這個方法，凡是大乘經裡頭，（什麼叫做「大乘」？下邊「皆是大阿羅漢」一句的解釋裡頭，會講明白的，都帶說著的）若是專門說這個方法的，有三部經，一部是《無量壽經》，一部是《觀無量壽佛經》，一部就是這《阿彌陀經》。前二部經，很長的，讀也很不容易，並 且經的句子，文理很深，所講的道理，同了修行的方法，又不是人人都能夠懂得、都能夠做得到的。
            只有這部《阿彌陀經》，說得最簡便，最明白，所以念佛的人，都要天天念的。但是佛經的文理，是很不容易懂的，雖然從前有許多高明的大法師，把這部《阿彌陀經》，詳詳細細的解釋，可惜都是文理很深的，讀書人還可以懂得，若是不懂文理的善男信女們，就不會明白 了。
            我看見許多信佛的善男信女們，大半都會念《阿彌陀經》的，但是這些善男信女們，口裡頭儘管念，究竟《阿彌陀經》講些什麼？念了有什麼好處？那就不曉得的多了。有些婦人們，竟然把這部《阿彌陀經》看得很輕的，說道念了《阿彌陀經》，死了去做起鬼來，可以抵得 多少錢用。
            咳！這真是笑話了，《阿彌陀經》的好處，說也說不盡，那裡只可以抵做錢用呢，況且一個人死了，總要盼望生到西方極樂世界去，纔可以免得這生了又死，死了又生的無窮無盡的苦惱，那裡可以打這種做鬼的主意呢？
            我因為可憐這些善男信女們，白用功夫，所以我把這部《阿彌陀經》，一段一段分開了，再把他一句一句，用白話來詳詳細細的解釋明白，並且用兩種方法來解釋：
            一種解釋，叫做解，就是下面前邊一種小字，開頭有一個【解】字的，這是完全照了經的字句，簡簡單單解釋的。
            但是有好多地方，只不過照字句解釋，還恐怕不明白，一定再要把他的來根，大略說幾句，纔會懂得的，這種的解釋，就是下面後邊一種小字，開頭有一個﹝釋﹞字的。若是讀這本經的人，只要曉得些大略的意思，那麼只要看【解】，倘然要曉得明白些的那未看了【解】， 再看﹝釋﹞，都可以隨便的。
            不過我雖然用白話來解釋，但是我仍舊照了從前許多很高明的大法師，用文理來解釋的話，把他改做白話罷了，並沒有一句，照我自己的意思解釋的。
            還恐怕有不妥當的地方，教人看了，倒反誤人，所以又請了普陀山的印光老法師改正過的。你們讀這本經的人，可以放心，不會還有錯誤的了。
            但願你們看了這本白話解釋的《阿彌陀經》，大家照這本經上所說的方法，一心一意的，相信西方真有這種極樂世界，時時刻刻，發出願心來，要想到西方極樂世界去，只消天天念佛，一定可以去的。
            念佛越念得多越好，自己念了，還要勸勸你們的父母兄弟，親戚朋友，大家都發心，一同做善人，一同念佛，一同要想到西方極樂世界去。
            平常時候，各種善的事情，都要去做做，各種惡的事情，一些些也不要做，那麼一定會成功的。若是我說了謊，騙你們，我死了去到閻羅王那裡，要受拔舌的罪的。
            你們相信了我的話，將來我同你們，都到西方極樂世界去，做阿彌陀佛的弟子，同了觀世音、大勢至、文殊、普賢、許多的大菩薩，還有往生的許多最上等的善人，(往生的往字、就是去字的意思，往生、就是生到西方極樂世界去。)常在一塊兒，親近阿彌陀佛，聽佛說法， 就可以漸漸的修行，漸漸的進步上去，一直到成佛的地位了。

            青海省西宁市城东区人民检察院以东检公诉刑诉［2016］489号起诉书指控被告人郑术文犯盗窃罪，于2016年10月19日向本院提起公诉。本院受理后，依法组成合议庭，公开开庭进行了审理。西宁市城东区人民检察院指派检察员魏岩麟依法出庭支持公诉，被告人郑术文到庭参加了诉讼。现已审理终结。
            公诉机关指控：2016年7月7日晚9时许，被告人郑术文前往被害人张某某位于本市某某号的家中做客，期间趁被害人张某某不备，在该房屋卧室衣柜的女士包内盗得车钥匙一把。当晚10时许，被告人郑术文离开被害人张某某家中后，利用盗取的车钥匙将被害人张某某丈夫鲜某某停放在附近的一辆车牌号为“XXXXXX”北京现代牌途胜越野车打开后并开走。次日9时许，被害人鲜某某发现车辆被盗后随即向公安机关报警。2016年7月12日被告人郑术文在本市城东区博雅路附近抓获，被盗车辆被追回并发还被害人鲜某某。经鉴定，被盗“XXXXXX”北京现代牌途胜越野车价值人民币156200.00元。

            汤三林诉上海川也电机有限公司工伤保险待遇纠纷一案二审民事判决书
            上诉人汤三林因与被上诉人上海川也电机有限公司（以下简称川也公司）劳动合同纠纷一案，不服上海市浦东新区人民法院（2016）沪0115民初51556号民事判决，向本院提起上诉。本院于2016年12月12日立案后，依法组成合议庭进行了审理。本案现已审理终结。
            汤三林上诉请求：撤销一审判决，依法改判川也公司支付汤三林一次性伤残就业补助金扣除的4,000元，支付两个手指甲10,000元，返还2014年7月1日至2014年7月30日的罚款十倍4,800元，返还部分医疗费16,825元，返还2012年11月24日至2013年5月23日期间交通费2,650元，支付违法解除劳动合同赔偿金4,000元。事实和理由：上诉人汤三林的确在2014年8月19日签过一份承诺书，因为如果不签,被上诉人川也公司就不支付一次性伤残就业补助金和8月份的工资。后来，汤三林的一次性伤残就业补助金被扣掉了4,000元。2014年9月15日汤三林只收到了8月份的工资，没收到一次性伤残就业补助金。因此，川也公司应返还当时扣除的4,000元以及罚款480元的十倍4,800元。一审没有支持手指甲等费用有误。部分医疗费16,825元是一审之后发生的。综上，汤三林请求二审法院依法改判。
            川也公司辩称：1、一审判决事实清楚、证据确凿充分。就本案劳动合同争议，双方已经经过仲裁、一审、二审和执行程序，并有相关裁判文书。2、上诉人汤三林的上诉理由不成立，其上诉明显违背民事诉讼法规定的“一事不再理”原则。对于两个手指甲10,000元的请求完全不成立，已经在劳动争议中解决。汤三林于2016年7月13日向法院起诉，超过了劳动争议申请仲裁期限为一年的法定时效。一审判决正确，川也公司请求驳回上诉，维持原判。
            汤三林向一审法院起诉请求：判令川也公司支付鉴定费350元、2012年11月24日至2013年3月23日期间护理费9,560元、2012年11月24日至2013年5月23日期间交通费3,500元、两个手指甲10,000元、精神损失费12,000元、2013年6月2日至2014年8月31日期间医疗费4,500元、停工留薪期工资差额17,500元、违法解除劳动合同赔偿金27,000元。
            一审法院认定事实：汤三林于2012年8月3日至川也公司工作，双方签订过一份期限为2013年8月26日至2014年8月26日的劳动合同。2012年11月24日，汤三林在工作中手被机床压伤。汤三林的此次受伤于2012年12月21日被认定为工伤，于2014年4月1日被鉴定为因工致残程度十级。2014年9月1日，汤三林填写普通职工辞（离）职表。川也公司为汤三林缴纳社会保险至2014年8月。
            汤三林曾于2014年11月19日向上海市浦东新区劳动人事争议仲裁委员会申请仲裁，要求川也公司支付一次性工伤医疗补助金15,108元、一次性伤残就业补助金15,108元、2012年11月24日至2013年6月1日的停工留薪期工资差额26,975元、2012年11月24日至2013年6月1日的医疗费2,600元、2012年12月1日至2013年4月30日的住院护理费6,000元、2013年6月1日至2014年8月30日的双休日加班工资28,000元并返还2014年7月1日至2014年7月30日的罚款4,800元。该仲裁委员会作出仲裁裁决，汤三林不服，向上海市浦东新区人民法院提起诉讼，上海市浦东新区人民法院作出（2015）浦民一(民)初字第6892号民事判决书，判决由川也公司支付汤三林2012年11月24日至2013年5月30日停工留薪期工资差额8,306.87元、2014年7月1日至2014年7月30日的罚款480元、2013年6月1日至2014年8月30日的延时和双休日加班工资差额6,800.44元、一次性伤残就业补助金11,000元，驳回汤三林的其余诉讼请求。汤三林不服提起上诉，上海市第一中级人民法院作出（2015）沪一中民三(民)终字第1993号民事判决书，判决驳回上诉，维持原判。
            2016年5月25日，汤三林再次作为申请人向上海市浦东新区劳动人事争议仲裁委员会申请仲裁，要求川也公司支付鉴定费350元、2013年6月2日至2014年8月31日期间医疗费20,970元、2012年11月24日至2013年3月23日期间生活护理费8,000元、2012年11月24日至2013年5月23日工伤医疗期间交通费2,500元、违法解除劳动合同赔偿金27,000元。2016年5月26日，上海市浦东新区劳动人事争议仲裁委员会作出浦劳人仲（2016）通字第127号不予受理通知书，以申请人的请求已超过申请时效为由，决定不予受理。汤三林不服，诉至一审法院。
            一审法院认为，根据我国民事诉讼“一事不再理”的原则，汤三林曾就本案中提出的停工留薪期工资差额及2012年12月1日至2013年3月23日期间护理费的请求提起仲裁、诉讼，上海市浦东新区人民法院已在（2015）浦民一(民)初字第6892号民事判决书中作出判决，汤三林上诉后，上海市第一中级人民法院判决驳回上诉，维持原判，故汤三林再次就上述请求提起诉讼，不符合法律规定，应予驳回。
            根据我国劳动争议调解仲裁法的相关规定，劳动争议申请仲裁的时效期间为一年；仲裁时效期间从当事人知道或者应当知道其权利被侵害之日起计算。双方劳动合同于2014年8月26日期限届满，2014年9月1日汤三林本人也填写了普通职工辞（离）职表，至此汤三林已知晓双方劳动关系终结。汤三林如认为其权利被侵害，应当在双方劳动关系终结后及时申请劳动仲裁，而汤三林迟至2016年5月25日方申请劳动仲裁，显然已超过一年的申请时效。庭审中川也公司明确提出了超过时效的抗辩意见，故对于汤三林提出的鉴定费、2012年11月24日至2012年11月30日期间护理费、2012年11月24日至2013年5月23日期间交通费、2013年6月2日至2014年8月31日期间医疗费、违法解除劳动合同赔偿金的请求，一审法院不予支持。
            对于汤三林提出的两个手指甲10,000元及精神损失费12,000元的请求，因未经仲裁前置程序，非本案处理范围，故一审法院对此不予处理。
            据此，依照《中华人民共和国劳动争议调解仲裁法》第二十七条第一款、《中华人民共和国民事诉讼法》第一百二十四条第（五）项的规定，一审法院于二○一六年九月二十日判决：驳回汤三林的诉讼请求（不包含不予处理部分）。案件受理费10元，减半计5元，免予收取。
            二审中，当事人没有提交新证据。经审理查明，一审法院认定的事实无误，双方亦无异议，本院予以确认。
            二审中，汤三林要求补充一节事实，称2014年9月1日其所填写的普通职工辞（离）职表是被川也公司所迫。川也公司对此不予认可。鉴于二审中汤三林表示系受伤后还要加班，实在受不了而填写，并无证据证明其受川也公司胁迫，本院对该补充事实不予认定。
            二审中，汤三林表示上诉请求中所提出的返还部分医疗费16,825元，并非本案仲裁和一审时提出的2013年6月2日至2014年8月31日期间的医疗费，而是本案一审后所产生的医疗费。
            本院认为，关于一次性伤残就业补助金扣除的4,000元和返还2014年7月1日至2014年7月30日的罚款十倍4,800元两项请求，汤三林并未在浦劳人仲（2016）通字第127号案件中提出，本案中未经仲裁前置程序，亦未向一审法院提出。有关请求已在前案中提出的，应依照生效判决主张权利。未在前案中提出的，汤三林应依法另行主张。已在前案中处理的，若汤三林不服，应通过申诉途径解决。
            汤三林由于手被机床压伤，其提出的所谓的两个手指甲10,000元，由于未经仲裁前置程序，一审不予处理正确。汤三林要求返还部分医疗费16,825元，系在本案一审后所产生，未经仲裁前置程序。汤三林坚持该请求的，应依法另行主张。
            关于2012年11月24日至2013年5月23日期间交通费和违法解除劳动合同赔偿金，一审在作出判决时已说明了理由，该理由正确，判决亦正确，本院不再赘述。
            综上，汤三林虽坚持上诉，但并没有新的证据提供，其上诉请求不能成立，应予驳回；一审判决认定事实清楚，适用法律正确，应予维持。依照《中华人民共和国民事诉讼法》第一百七十条第一款第一项之规定，判决如下：
            驳回上诉，维持原判。
            二审案件受理费人民币10元，由上诉人汤三林负担。
            本判决为终审判决。

            徐闻县农村信用合作联社与陈某1、陈某2金融借款合同纠纷一审民事判决书
            原告徐闻县农村信用合作联社（以下简称信用联社）诉被告陈某1、陈某2金融借款合同纠纷一案，本院于2017年11月21日受理后，依法适用普通程序，于2017年12月26日公开开庭进行了审理。信用联社法定代表人林一贝的委托代理人陈某某到庭参加诉讼，陈某1、陈某2经本院传票传唤无正当理由拒不到庭参加诉讼，本院依法缺席审理。本案现已审理终结。
            原告信用联社向本院提出的诉讼请求：1、判令陈某1偿还借款本金27616元及利息26314.60元（利息从2010年8月12日计至2017年7月27日止，续后利息按合同约定计至还清欠款之日止）；2、判令陈某2对该笔借款担保保证有效并负连带清偿责任；3、判令陈某1、陈某2负担本案一切诉讼费用。
            事实与理由：2007年9月9日陈某1与信用联社所属前山信用社签定《保证担保借款合同》一份，合同约定，借款30000元，借款期限二年，月利率7.5‰，还款方式为按季还息，到期还本。陈某2作为担保保证人在《保证担保借款合同》保证人栏上签名，并在《担保贷款保证书》上签名。合同签定后，前山信用社依约借款给陈某1，陈某1给前山信用社立下《借款借据》一份。借款后，陈某1偿还借款本金2384元及利息8526.44元（2007年9月9日至2010年8月11日）。借款逾期后，前山信用社多次向陈某1催收追讨本息，但陈某1总是以各种理由推诿，为维护国家集体财产合法权益，请求法院准许信用联社上述诉讼请求。
            陈某1、陈某2未向本院提交答辩意见，亦未参加本院庭审和提交证据。
            信用联社围绕诉讼请求依法提交：《企业法人营业执照》、《组织机构代码证》、《法人代表身份证》、《居民身份证》、《保证担保借款合同》、《借款借据》、《担保贷款保证书》、《广东省农村信用社贷款自动扣款收回本金回单》、《金融业务收入凭证》、《贷款催收通知书》等证据，本院进行了举证质证。本院对信用联社提交的证据予以确认并在卷佐证。
            根据当事人陈述和经审查确认，本院认定事实如下：
            2007年9月9日陈某1与信用联社所属前山信用社签定《保证担保借款合同》一份，合同约定，借款30000元，借款期限二年，既从2007年9月9日起至2009年9月8日，月利率7.5‰，还款方式为按季还息，到期还本。陈某2作为担保保证人在《保证担保借款合同》保证人栏上签名，并在《担保贷款保证书》上签名，同意担保期间至2012年9月9日止。合同签定后，前山信用社依约借款给陈某1，陈某1给前山信用社立下《借款借据》一份。借款后，陈某1偿还借款本金2384元及利息8526.44元（2007年9月9日至2010年8月11日）。借款逾期后，前山信用社派人多次向陈某1催收本息，陈某1只是在《贷款催收通知书》签名，但却以各种理由推诿，拒绝还款付息。信用联社多次催收未果，遂于2017年11月21日诉至本院。
            本院认为，陈某1向信用联社所属前山信用社借款系双方当事人真实意思表示，合同内容明确、具体，其内容不违反国家法律、法规的强制性规定，合法有效，双方应严格按照约定履行义务。信用联社按合同约定已向陈某1履行了贷款的义务，陈某1则应按合同约定到期返还借款并支付利息。但陈某1未按约定履行合同义务，偿还借款本息，其行为构成违约，现信用联社主张陈某1偿还借款本金27616元，并支付按约定7.5‰月利率自2010年8月12日起至借款还清之日止的利息的诉讼请求，本院予以支持。
            此外，陈某2在《保证担保借款合同》上签名，并在《担保贷款保证书》上签名，同意为陈某1该笔借款提供担保，担保期间至2012年9月9日止。本案的借款时间是2007年9月9日，借款期限是二年，即借款期于2009年9月8日届满，原告于2017年11月21日起诉，保证期间已届满。根据《中华人民共和国担保法》第二十六条：“连带责任保证的保证人与债权人未约定保证期间的，债权人有权自主债务履行期届满之日起六个月内要求保证人承担保证责任。
            在合同约定的保证期间和前款规定的保证期间，债权人未要求保证人承担保证责任的，保证人免除保证责任。”的规定，免除陈某2的保证责任。
            现信用联社请求确认陈某2对该笔借款担保保证有效，证据不足，本院不予支持。
            陈某1、陈某2经本院依法传票传唤，无正当理由未到庭参加诉讼，视为放弃庭审抗辩权利，不影响本院依据查明的事实和证据进行裁判。
            综上所述，依照《中华人民共和国民法总则》第一百一十九条、策一百七十六条、第一百七十八条，《中华人民共和国合同法》第二百零五条、第二百零六条、第二百零七条，《中华人民共和国担保法》第二十六条，《中华人民共和国民事诉讼法》第一百四十四条之规定，判决如下：
            一、限被告陈某1在本判决发生法律效力后五日内清还原告徐闻县农村信用合作联社借款本金27616元及支付自2010年8月12日起至借款付清之日止以7.5‰月利率计算的利息。如果未按本判决指定的期限履行给付金钱义务，应当依照《中华人民共和国民事诉讼法》第二百五十三条之规定，加倍支付迟延履行期间的债务利息。
            二、驳回原告徐闻县农村信用合作联社其他诉讼请求。
            案件受理费1148元，由被告陈某1负担（原告已垫付，被告付款时迳退给原告）。
            如不服本判决，可在判决书送达之日起十五日内，向本院递交上诉状，并按对方当事人的人数提出副本，上诉于湛江市中级人民法院。

            本紀·史 記 卷 二 夏本紀第二
            夏禹，【集解】謚法曰：「受禪成功曰禹。」【正義】夏者，帝禹封國號也。帝王紀云：「禹受封爲夏伯，在豫州外方之南，今河南陽翟是也。」名曰文命。【索隱】尚書云「文命敷于四海」，孔安國云「外布文德教命」，不云是禹名。太史公皆以放勳、重華、文命爲堯、舜、禹之名，未必爲得。孔又云 「虞氏，舜名」，則堯、禹、湯皆名矣。蓋古者帝王之號皆以名，後代因其行，追而爲謚。其實禹是名。故張晏云「少昊已前，天下之號象其德；顓頊已來，天下之號因其名」。又按：系本「鯀取有辛氏女，謂之女志，是生高密」。宋衷云「高密，禹所封國」。【正義】帝王紀云：「父鯀妻脩己，見流星貫昴，夢接意感，又吞神珠薏苡，胸坼而生禹。名文命，字密，身九尺二寸長，本西夷人也。大戴禮云『高陽之孫，鯀之子，曰文命』。楊雄蜀王本紀云『禹本汶山郡廣柔縣人也，生於石紐』。」括地志云：「茂州汶川縣石紐山在縣西七十三里。華陽國志云『今夷人共營其地，方百里不敢居牧，至今猶不敢放六畜。」按：廣柔，隋改曰汶川。禹之父曰鯀，鯀之父曰帝顓頊，【索隱】皇甫謐云：「鯀，帝顓頊之子，字熙。」又連山易云「鯀封於崇」，故國語謂之「崇伯鯀」。系本亦以鯀爲顓頊子。漢書律曆志則云「顓頊五代而生鯀」。按：鯀既仕堯，與舜代系殊懸，舜即顓頊六代孫，則鯀非是顓頊之子。蓋班氏之言近得其實。顓頊之父曰昌意，昌意之父曰黃帝。禹者，黃帝之玄孫而帝顓頊之孫也。禹之曾大父昌意及父鯀皆不得在帝位，爲人臣。
            當帝堯之時，鴻水【索隱】一作「洪」。鴻，大也。以鳥大曰鴻，小曰鴈，故近代文字大義者皆作「鴻」也。滔天，浩浩懷山襄陵，下民其憂。堯求能治水者羣臣四嶽皆曰鯀可。堯曰：「鯀爲人負命毀族，不可。」四嶽曰：「等之未有賢於鯀者，願帝試之。」於是堯聽四嶽，用鯀治水。九年而水不息，功用不成。於是帝堯乃求人，更得舜。舜登用，攝行天子之政，巡狩。行視鯀之治水無狀，【索隱】言無功狀。乃殛鯀於羽山以死。【正義】殛音紀力反。鯀之羽山，化爲黃熊，入于羽淵。熊音乃來反，下三點為三足也。束??發蒙紀云：「鱉三足曰熊。」天下皆以舜之誅爲是。於是舜舉鯀子禹，而使續鯀之業。
            堯崩，帝舜問四嶽曰：「有能成美堯之事者使居官？」皆曰：「伯禹爲司空，可成美堯之功。」舜曰：「嗟，然！」命禹：「女平水土，維是勉之。」禹拜稽首，讓於契、后稷、皋陶。舜曰：「女其往視爾事矣。」

            回答：
        -  |
            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：我想在十来分钟的时间讲一讲绿色金融本身的情况。 那么重点的探讨一下绿色金融怎么样来支持碳中和此后还有一些国际上的最新的动向，也给大家介绍一下关于绿色金融的情况。 刚才秘书长也简单提到，我们中国很多年以前就启动了构建绿色金融体系这样工作。 那么在 2016 年的时候，由人民银行牵头的七部委就已经发布了关于历史金融指导意见。 在指导意见框架之下，我们构建了至少有四大支柱的绿色金融体系。 其中有关于标准披露产品和激励机制这个四大支柱所谓标准，主要指的是我们现在已经有的三套关于绿色信贷的界定标准，绿色债券的界定标准和绿色产业的目录。
            讲者1：那披露主要是关于环境信息披露的要求。 因为作为要融资的企业，如果你要融得绿色资金的话，你必须要产生环境效应，要得跟市场说清楚，到底你减了多少碳，减了多少二氧化硫、氮氧化、污水这样的信息必须要披露。 第三，在产品层面，我们开发了一系列的产品和工具，包括绿色信贷、绿色债券、绿色基金、绿色保险等等。 刚才秘书长讲的那几个数字稍微有点老，现在最新的情况是我们绿色信贷的余额已经达到十六万亿，这是全球第一。 绿色债券过去 6 年发了将近有 2 万亿，现在绿色债券的余额我们排名是全球第二。 其他的一些金融产品也都在快速的成长过程当中。 包括最近开始出现的跟可持续挂钩的债券跟可持续挂钩的贷款等等都是很有新意的，也是针对碳中和所涉及的一些产品。 那么关于激励机制，主要是讲的政府采用各种让手段，让这些绿色项目能够提高他们的回报率，从而调动更多的私营部门参与的积极性。
            讲者1：比如说在中央的层面，我们去年由央行推出了一个叫碳减排支持工具，这个工具它专门是支持碳减排的项目，包括新能源里面的光伏、风电、氢能、储能、生物制等等这些项目。 那么也包括工业解盘的项目，也包括 ccus 的项目。 那么如何是符合这些标准的项目就可以到银行去申请一个贷款，而这个贷款是得到碳减牌知识工具的支持的。 具体运作的方式是银行先给这个企业贷款，然后银行再拿这个贷款到人民银行去报销。 我们简称叫俗称，是一个报销的体制。
            讲者1：除了这个知识工具以外，还有很多别的对绿色金融的激励机制。 比如说我们地方层面现在有六省 8 市叫绿色金融改革试验区，他们都推出了关于绿色项目的担保贴息的制度。 比如说中国的浙江省湖州市就是做得非常好的一个绿色金融改革试验区。 他们每年拿出 10 个亿的财政资金通过担保贴息这类的是工具来，引导社会资本进入到绿色的产业当中去效果非常好。
            讲者1：在这些激励机制的推动之下，他们当地的绿色信贷的增长率每年都可以达到 30% 左右，而且不良率控制得很低。 那么在碳中和背景下，这些绿色金融要素都在得到不断地完善。 比如说标准层面，我们去年就由人民行修改了绿色信贷的绿色债券的目录。 那么把这个原来我们认为是绿的，比如说清洁酶技术从这个老的绿带目录里面就给它剔除掉了。 所以新的绿带目录里面已经没有这些高碳的项目。
            讲者1：那么当时为什么要把清洁煤放进去呢？ 因为在 201415 年的时候，当时我们设计早期的绿色目录的时候，主要的关注点还是要减污染，尤其是减空气污染。 那么脱流脱效这些清洁酶的技术它确实能够减污染，但是它减不了碳排放。 目前在碳中和的大背景之下，我们实现碳减排已经成为我们绿色发展的一个更加重要的任务。 所以基于这么一个大的政策重点的调整，就把这个清洁酶之类的虽然能够产生一部分环境效益，但同时不能减碳的这种项目从那个目录里面剔除掉。
            讲者1：另外在披露领域当中我们越来越多的是要求企业和金融机构要披露碳排放的信息，因为未来你要实现碳达峰，碳中和，必须要知道你的碳强度是多少才可能计算多少年之内通过什么样的项目能把碳排放减多少。 如果你碳排放了多少都不知道没有办法做碳剂量的话，你实现碳减排也是不可能的。 所以现在要做的工作是两个层面，一个是在企业层面，要求企业要能够做自己的碳核算。 那么另外一个是在金融机构的层面，逐步地要求金融机构来计算它的资产的碳强度比如说银行贷款，这个你的每万元贷款产生了多少碳排放要有办法算出来。
            讲者1：当然现在还是刚刚起步的阶段，现在还没有完全到位，已经有了一些试点，尤其在广东地区已经进行了一部分金融机构的碳核算的试点。 那么这些信息以后都要放进披露的要求当中去产品领域当中，现在随着碳中和的推进，已经有一些跟碳挂钩的产品。 刚才讲到了一个例子，就是跟碳减排的业绩相关的贷款和债券。 这什么意思呢？ 这些债券和贷款的利率它是浮动的，不是个固定的。 如果这家企业的碳减排的效果比原来预期的好，那么我利息就可以降下来。 如果你的碳减排的效果没有像原来预期这么高，我的利率就要上去。 这样的话，这个浮动的利率就形成了一个对碳减排的激励和约束的机制。 那么这种方法可以用在贷款，也可以用在债券其实也可以放进其他的金融工具的设计当中，甚至股权投资也可以考虑跟碳减排的效果挂钩。 此外就是在激励机制这个层面上，我想未来会有更多的激励机制。
            讲者1：除了我们现在讲的碳减排的知识工具之外，未来我们预计还会有国家推出这个专门支持碳减排的和转型的这些基金。 那么地方政府也在设计一些跟碳减班相关的转型金融的政策框架。 比如说除刚才讲到的那个浙江湖州已经推出了一个转型金融的政策框架，而且把转型金融的目录给编制出来。 转型进入什么意思呢？ 其实它是整个碳中和当中非常重要的一环，就是指高碳企业向低碳的一个转型。 那么这个过程当中，如果你满足了一定的技术路径的要求，能够实现这个比较好的在一段时间当中简单的效果，那么就应该纳入到转型金融知识的这个对象当中去，同时政府也会给予一定的激励机制。
            讲者1：那么简单说一下国际的绿色金融方面的一些情况。 现在国际上有很多合作机制也推动一些新的倡议。 比如说 G twenty 叫 g20 可持续金融工作组。 这个平台其实是 2016 年由中国主导发起的。 大家可能记得 2016 年中国担任 g20 的主席国，当年我们就发起了 g20 绿色金融小组，我有幸从那个时候开始就担任这个小组的共同主席。 那么这个小组现在已经演化成为 g20 可实际金融工作组，由中国和美国担任工程主席，我有幸代表中国，美国是他们财政部的一个官员。
            讲者1：那么在这个工作组旗下，去年形成了一套 g20 可持续金融路线图，这套路线图将指引国际的绿色金融和可视与金融的工作。 那么这个路线图当中去年的几个亮点，我想给大家简单介绍一下。 第一就是要建立一套转型金融的框架，把未来的由高碳向低碳转型的金融活动要做一些具体的安排。 比如说要明确它的界定标准，要明确如何进行披露要推出一批专门支持转型的金融工具，包括债权的、股权的、保险类的金融工具。 那么要有相应的激励机制。 在路线题当中，第二个很重要的亮点就是要推出全球一致的关于可实际信息的披露标准。 大家也知道披露方面现在各个国家也都在做自己的工作，互相来讲不一定协调。 那么如果每个国家都有一套不同的披露要求，作为跨境资本流动来讲就会面临很多的阻力。 我举一个极端的例子，假设一个国际的，一个投资组合的基金经理的管理者，他要看来自于 30 个国家的上市公司的话。 那么每个国家如果她披露要求不一样，他的披露的内容和含义都不一样，他就很难做一个比较。 到底哪个企业是真正意义上的绿色的，哪个企业是不太绿的。 所以未来要逐步的统一全球的跟环境、气候可持续性相关的一些披露的要求。
            讲者1：这个就是 g20 所支持的一个叫 isb 这么一个新的国际组织，这个 issp 的全称叫 international systemity standard board 已经在去年 11 月份正式成立了。 那么他们还在构建他们的治理结构的过程当中，我想不久的将来将正式开始运作。 那么 ssb 提供的一套披露的要求逐步的将转化为各个国家监管部门对自己的企业和金融机构的要求。
            讲者1：g20 去年在路线图当中提出的第三个我觉得也很重要的方向就是可视与金融。 未来不光要覆盖传统的环境的罂粟，气候的罂粟也要覆盖生物多样性。 那么这是最近多个国际组织，包括 g20 也包括央行历经网络在共同推动的一个理念就是除了汽油变化将为人类带来重大挑战之外，本世纪人类面临的另一个重大挑战就是生物多样性的丧失，它也可能会影响金融稳定。
            讲者1：那么作为金融监管部门，包括央行和银保监这样的机构，他们未来还要关注金融如何来保护生活多样性和防范由于生活多样性上市所带来的金融风险。 那么这方面的细节比较多，我想限于时间关系，我就点一个题，请大家不光是关注这个碳减排这一项重要的这个可持续性的内容。 同时在中长期也要关注如何保护自然和保护生物多样性。 好我就讲到这，谢谢。

            会议总结：
        -  |
            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：我们第一位请是这个陈文林老师非常荣幸，还第一位就是一位女经济学家，是一位女士陈老师是这个中国国际经济交流中心的总经济师，还曾经担任过国务院研究室的司长也是这个商务部的专家，有请陈老师非常荣幸。 全球库，智库非常值得赞赏，他们出了很多的专注，组织了很多的活动，尤其是辉耀这个在中美关系世界人物台上，这个苗缕就非常的活跃我特别赞赏。 在这个中美关系处在这个困难的时刻，不要和这个美国的著名学者、专家、政客们进行了一系列都是深度的访谈每一个访谈的都不是说像我们这五分钟啥也说不了，都是俩小时三小时，我都那个很多都拜读了，我觉得是非常有水平的，这几句话就不算我的时间了。 我觉得现在就是我就想这个世界是平的原来这个全球化过程中有学者指出来世界是平的。 后来又有学者说世界是信的其实前一段时间我觉得世界是斜的倾斜负均衡。 但是现在世界是乱的，世界百年未有之大变局，处在这个这个急剧的变动和演化之中。 所以在这样的一个情况下，这个全球化处于历史的十字路口。
            讲者1：我谈几个观点。 第一，人类面临着共同的挑战。 正如习主席所指出的，人类还未走出世纪疫情的阴霾，又面为新的传统安全风险，全球经济复苏中脆弱乏力又叠加发展鸿沟加剧的矛盾、气候变化等，治理池子尚未添补，数字治理等新课题又摆在我们面前。 那我说世界是乱的，为什么说世界是乱的呢？ 其实由于这些种种原因，公共卫生危机、能源危机、粮食危机、难免危机、生态危机和金融风险、债务风险、产业链、供应链断链的风险、战争风险交织叠加。 四大池子治理池子、信任池子、和平池子、发展池子急剧增长。 国际货币基金组织、世界银行、联合国连续下调了对世界经济增长的预期。 而且世界银行预测，世界经济将经历发射出现多年以来最大的一个幅度的建减速。 全球债务监测报告显示，全球债务总额已经达到三百零三万亿，占全球 GDP 的百分之三百五十一。 联合国粮食计划署指出，人类或将面临第二次世界大战后最大的粮食危机，能源危机多达 17 亿人，正暴露在粮食、能源和金融系统的破坏之下。
            讲者1：第二个观点就是我们的人类各个国家面临着共同的考试，其实对于考试题有很多。 但是现在我觉得可能对于全球化来说，对于全球经济来说，面临的这些考题集中在几个方面。 第一，世界到底能不能一分为二一分为三一分为四或者成为碎片化的状态？ 那如果出现这种情况，世界的前生命运将是怎样一幅愿景？ 实际上现在我们还是也是全球经济还是一体化这个格局，总的这个状态没有打破。 那么如果像一些政客推进的这些去宣传化去中国化或者是搞这个两套体系。
            讲者1：那么世界会选择什么样？ 第二，世界经济能不能没有稳定之矛绑购？ 世界经济增长的稳定之矛，货币体系的稳定之矛，大宗商品价格的稳定之矛，产业链供应链的稳定之矛如何摒弃脱钩断供、单边制裁、极限施压贸易壁垒全球产业链供应链断链小院方高强这些能找到根本解决之道到底有没有稳定之矛？ 第三，世界的大国之间究竟应该怎样相处？ 什么是真正的多边主义？ 是构建人类命运共同体？ 还是把一个国家的利益置于其他国家和全球利益之上？ 是遵守国际秩序国际规则间，还是把加法和方规变成打压遏制制裁其他国家的工具。
            讲者1：那么这个第四就是如何避免发生冲突和局部战争，对战后几十年的二百多场战争如何评价？ 那么如何定义现代战争啊？ 那么现在战争是不是只是战场上的战争？ 那么生物战、经济、标准规则之战、货币战、信息站、网络站、舆论站。 那么和现代战争它怎么成为一个一体化的新型战争如何解决当前的俄乌冲突？ 如何避免新冷战和第三次世界大战和第三次世界大战。 那么第五这是第几了，说错了一二三四第五就是如何建立有利于全球降低四大池子的国际秩序与国际规则，构建保持全球数据和平稳健均衡发展安全整体的这样的环境。 那么第六如何构建全球公共品的供给体系。
            讲者1：那么新型的全球公共品它的概念定义内涵是什么？ 和过去霸权国家主宰下的公共品究竟有什么不同？ 那么再一个我觉得在当前如何进行全球宏观经济政策的沟通和协调，怎样赋予并充分发挥联合国、世界银行 AI 还复杂不出等国际组织进行全球政策沟通协调的这个功能。
            讲者1：例如美国加息现在是政策急转弯。 到目前为止，已经跟进美国加息的国家包括美国在内，那么它的这个经济总量已经占到全球 GDP 的60.6%， 进口总量占了全球进口市场的42.2%。 所以世界银行对这些家期跟进的国家进行了评估，就是他们的 2022 年民营 GDP 增速将比 2021 年减少 4.2  个百分点，损失 GDP 达到 2.42  万亿美元，损失消费额 1.69  万亿美元，这将导致全球 GDP 增速下降2.55， 导致全球出口减少百分之七点五一，而且还会导致一大批发展中国家自己短缺。 美元荒货币大幅度贬值。 那么经济发展严重受到严重重创。 所以现在一系列的这个非常严峻的，就大家不得不回答这些问题，就摆在我们的面前，实际上这也关乎到经济权益化的一个命运，人类发生的命运。
            讲者1：第三个这个观点就是共同的不同的出路和选择。  4 月 20 号在国外论坛会议上，习主席讲话，世界各国创作的一条命令，与共的大船上要穿越镜头排浪驶向光明，未来必须从舟共济，企图把谁扔下大海都是不可接受的。 那么在最近习主席在 76 届这个联合联会上，就是去年习主席讲国际社会发展的今天已经成为一部复杂精巧、有机一体的机器，拆掉一个零部件就会使整个机器运转面临严重困难，被拆的人会受损，拆的人也会受损。 那么战后到现在 77 年已经形成了世界经济的金融格局。 地缘政治经济的基本国籍和世界各国认同的秩序、国际规则和国际经济运行的这些制度性安排。 那么全球的投资贸易布局、产业链、供应链布局、互联网、物联网、空中导航系统、人工智能下一代数字基础设施和高科技的运动发展都是为了互联，都是为了造福于人类。
            讲者1：那么都是，它的背自然结果都会是全球的经济，社会联系越来越紧密，而不是脱钩分裂对抗阻断重构。 那么如果如果现在执意要推动这些这个一些政客出于去中国化也好，孤立其他国家也好。 那么这些行为我觉得最后会受到反噬。 那么建立全球化不仅会遭遇逆流，而且这一些阻断经济全球化的遏制经济全球化的对冲经济全球化的这一系列的行为。 也不管什么团体，也不管什么名头，我觉得最后都会受到历史的惩罚和抛弃。 谢谢。

            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：媒介话什么是何为媒这样的一个话题呢？ 其实也想听听各位的探讨，我们如何把这样的一个媒介化或者是中介这样一个概念放到中国的这个语境化里面来。 那么特别是中介化，它其实强调的是一种二元的对称。 因为媒介在中间传播的传者和受者或者传播的参与者在两边形成了一个这样二元中介对立的这样一个一个视角。 那么在中国语境里面，我们如何去理解这样一个比较基于西方二元论或者是媒介本体论的视角？ 那么是不是适用？ 我们还是说媒介学就应该基于这样的一个视角呢？ 本来一开始想请张正平老师比较银行，张老师现在还没有在线。 那么上一次也领读的话，戴雨成老师讲到了媒介化概念，我们今天先请戴老师来开一个头，好不好？ 也是我们这一季的这个新晋邀请的嘉宾。
            讲者2：谢谢吴老师我不知道应该以什么样的形式表达，就是是回答问题吗还是说那个。 就您可以盘点提醒。
            讲者1：好，你戴老师可以就是随便自己的这个这个理解或者是想法，或者比如说就可以基于您上一次的一个演讲或者是一个补充来谈一谈这个媒介或者是中介在中文语境中的这样一个看法。 因为确实我们读出会确实到目前为止，以及我们大量的关于媒介研究的一些话题和理论，其实都主要是来自于西方的。 所以我们怎么去理解这个中介性，包括在中国语境里面要不要中介这个话题。
            讲者2：我就抛砖引喻，我就谈一谈我自己一个比较粗浅的理解。 我个人是这样的，就是我我觉得就是首先这个我们今天去谈那个物质性或者说所谓的媒介物质性转向物质性以来的这种媒介本体论转向，我觉得它其实是有一个特定的理论的那个溯源或者说理论语境的。 也就是说其实每一个学者在谈论这样一个概念的时候，他们不一定会依赖着一个比较统一的语境。
            讲者2：比方说我们今天说这个物质性，其实每一个学者的定就是我们所援引的或者说我们阅读的书目中的每一个学者对于它定义是不一样的。 比方说我们在四辨识在论，比方说哈曼这种 OO 就误导向本体论的脉络中，他把物理解成一种隐退和那个显显现的那种二元那种张力，在拉图尔那里又是这样一种。 然后在基特勒那里，它可能又是另外一种。
            讲者2：所以我觉得如果我个人是理解，就是说如果我们要理解媒介或者说由媒介所衍生出的一个中介化和媒介化的概念的话，首先我们得把它回归到这样的一个概念，或者说这样一个概念中的这个学者所创造这个概念所自身依赖的一个理论语境。 那我自己这几年的一些阅读，我其实更多的是集中在社会理论这个领中。 所以当我去谈论中介化和媒介化的时候，我是在 social theory 这样一个理论语境中去讨论，就是它作为一种具体的技术物质的载体，或者说一种技术的配置是怎么样去中介特定的社会行动和社会实践，怎么样对所谓的那种行动者的这种实践发生某种改变和触动。
            讲者2：所以如果我要去理解中介化和媒介化，我想比较推荐的一个方式是大家大家不妨先去澄清自己的一个理论语境，在这样的一个理论语境中才去做进一步的概念甄别。 所以我昨上次去读那个书，我一开始就想做的是我说我这样的一个阅读是一个 social theary 的一个阅读，而并非其他。
            讲者2：那同样我们今天去理解中介，我觉得我所依赖的这样一个社会理论语境，绝对不是说是唯一的，甚至也不可能说是唯一是正确的，还是像希特勒这样一个像德国的这个柏林学派也好，或者更早的麦克鲁汉，他们其实更多的就是在一样一个技术理论或者技术哲学这样一个语境中。
            讲者2：那中介可能在基特论那里，在让一个技术理论和技术哲学的语境中，它又变成了一种去形塑人的特定的知识系统，使得这是系统产生特定的一种技术配置上的一种分输的一种所谓的技术配置。 然后希特勒讲的那个留声机、打印机，还有那个电影，其实就对我们思想系统做了三个不同维度的一个分数。 那我觉得这样的个在系统科勒那样一个技术理论为代表了语境中的话，其实中介又是这样的一种角色，其实跟我之前所定义的那种对于特定的社会实践的触动和扰动，这样一种终介可能又不太一样。
            讲者2：同样还有政治经济学的那个语境。 比方说像 Lisa pax 或者这个 star rosky 这样的一些做基础设施研究的其他们所理解的中介，可能跟我们上面所界定的这样一个社会理论或者说技术理论的中介又不太一样。 所以我抛砖引玉的谈一谈非常非常粗浅的想法。 就是当我们去界定概念的时候，我们应该是先去澄清的是自己概念，所以提然后再进一步的做。 可能相对来讲会形成一个比较好的一个共识。 好的，我就简单说这些，我不知道我的网络好不好。 吴老师能听到吗。

            讲者1：现在让我们欢迎自然教育的主创 risk 向以及专家学者和一线教育实践者共同探讨儿童的健康成长中玩儿和学的关系是什么，如何利用大自然开展校内教育？ 有请我们自然教育的主创与嘉宾有请。
            讲者2：大家好，欢迎大家来到第十三届哈佛中国教育论坛自然教育圆桌讨论。 我是今天的主持人 ris 自然名叫小向。 我毕业于哈佛大学教育学院人类发展心理学专业，是一名儿童自然教育实践者，也被戏称为爬树运动代言人。 非常高兴能够在北京时间星期一的早上，同时也是美国东部时间复活节的晚上和大家相遇。 欢迎大家。 本场活动组织形式为圆桌讨论，五位嘉宾有四位说中文，一位说英文，我主要说中文。 那么因时间关系，本场活动不设置观众提问环节，但我们非常欢迎大家在微信群、评论区和弹幕区提问留言。 我们将在论坛结束后选取有代表性的问题，在公众号上以文章的形式给大家回复。
            讲者2：那中国的双减政策推行以来，孩子们有了更多的自由时间，自然教育也受到了越来越多父母和教育者的关注。 到 2018 年底，中国大陆已有 418 所自然教育机构。 在西方教育史上，自然教育是一个重要理论，它侧重于根据人的自然本性和身心规律进行教育。 在中国，自然教育虽然还没有成为一种正规的教育形式，但是两千多年前，自然这个词就出现了，大家耳熟能详的词语道法自然，自然而然都反映了我们中国思想家对人与自然关系的深刻理解。 我知道相较于其他形式的教育，自然教育还是比较小众。
            讲者2：可能屏幕前的您会有一些疑问，自然还能是教育，到大自然中玩，谁不会，干嘛跟老师去，大自然中的玩中重要吗？ 能帮助学习吗？ 那您可能不知道这里面的门道很大，今天就让我们为您剥茧抽丝，一起聊聊自然教育的底层逻辑。 我们非常荣幸地邀请到了来自中美两国横跨学术领域、实践领域、城市儿童教育和乡村儿童教育的五位专家学者，共同探讨大自然探索和玩耍如何助力了儿童的成长。 那么我们今天的自然圆桌自然教育圆桌讨论会设计这些议题，如果您也感兴趣，千万不要走开。 那接下来我将为屏幕前的大家介绍今天的嘉宾，他们是来自美国波士顿学院的心理学教授、发展和心理学家，也是儿童自由万耍的倡导者。 美国 2019 年幼儿自然教育论坛主旨演讲嘉宾 petergrey 教授，北京天下西教育副总干事、乡土教材项目负责人，华夏文化推广十佳人物王小平老师，北京大学哲学系、北京大学科学传播中心教授、博士生导师，致力于博物学文化传播的刘华杰教授，还有来自南京师范大学教育科学学院的教授、博士生导师，中国学前教育研究会学前教育基本理论专委会副主任黄静老师，还有曾任美国哈佛大学附属幼儿园班主任和教研员，也是一名中美幼儿教育实践者的涂新老师。

            会议记录：
            讲者1：业很敬业的。 所以我们在介绍瑞士同时我现在非常想要给大家介绍的一点就是瑞士是一个中立的国家，政治很稳定。 如果企业想要到走出国门去国外发展做生意，做 business 的话，你肯定要选择一个比较稳定的政治，比较 stable 的一个国家。 另外中瑞两国的高层最近也是频繁地互动。 所以在这个方面其实瑞士是非常欢迎中国的企业去做任何的 business 我们作为官方机构就免费的为这些企业服务。 所以我想先我就这么简单的介绍一下瑞士。 如果有感兴趣的我们场后也可以留下联系方式，可以进这进一步的介绍给大家。 类似的情况，谢谢。 那我现在给同事介绍。
            讲者2：谢谢我来自英国国际贸易部。 我想说一下，不单瑞士有好的巧克力，英国也有好的巧克力。 那么在上海刚刚结束的 CIE 中国进口博览会上面英国的展台也展览了很多英国的好吃的好喝的好玩的东西。 英国简单来说就是世界第五大经济体，那么人口 6600 万左右。 那么在就是大学排名的话，全球十大大学英国有占四个。 在我所处的这个部门国际贸易部。 那么国际贸易部它是一个英国的部长级的部门。 那么它主要服务的它主要的职能包括引导英国企业在全球经济当中获得成功。 他同时也协助海外企业到英国进行高质量的投资，顺利地帮助海外企业在英国进行业务的开展，同时它也代表英国政府制定一些贸易跟政策和投资相关的政策。
            讲者2：其次呢因为英国脱欧的关系，那么我们国际贸易部也积极地代表英国政府和其他的国家正在商谈一些自由贸易协定。 那么最后呢啊出于对出口的鼓励，英国国际贸易部也对英国出口业者提供财政方面的一些支持。 那么从投资的角度上来讲，讲的话，我们主要服务的企业的服务海外企业的对象主要包括以下几点，第一个我们可以帮助他们组团访问英国。 那么当然现在并不是特别合适，出于众所周知的原因，不过很快就会没有事情，因为全境的疫苗就开始接种。 那么同时我们也帮助海外企业了解英国的市场，洞悉英国的行业的一些相关的情况。 更重要的是我们提供量化和评估在英国的投资的机会。
            讲者2：举一个例子，比方说我们有一个中国企业想要去看看欧洲的市场，从它所处的行业跟市场的情况来看，它并不确定它的产品跟服务是适合于英国瑞士、德国或者是法国。 那么我们国际贸易部可以出一份相当于定制化的比较权威的这么一个各个国家优势相比的优势对比的这么一份报告给到潜在的投资者，让他有一个清晰的认识。 那么同时我们也提供政府的资源，帮助他们联络关键的合作伙伴来从而打开进入英国市场的第一步。 基本上就是这么多。 那么如果大家还有问题，关于脱欧，关于英国抗疫甚至是关于怎么样获取国际贸易部的资源进入到英国市场，或者说想认识更多的英国的公司来中国来开展业务，我们可以会后继续交流，谢谢。
            讲者3：前面两位嘉宾主要介绍的是瑞士、英国，包括等一会，这个宋先生会介绍法国，我今天不是想推荐什么，不是想推荐一个国家，因为我所在的组织叫做全球能源转型委员会的全球能源转型委员会。 我今天其实想给大家推介的是一个概念，这个概念我认为或者说越来越多的人会认为带来这个在全球带来巨大的一个市场我觉得这个市场咱们的这个通用设备很多的企业，特别是咱们中国的企业会有非常大的收益。 如果能够抓住这些市场机会的话，那么我是来自于这个全球能源转型委员会中国秘书处我叫陈继，今天想跟大家推介的这概念就是这个全球的零碳或者是叫碳中和的这个能源转型。
            讲者3：大家都知道，我们前两天可能关注新闻，就知道说这个我们习总书记在这个 9 月 22 号的联大会议上，宣布中国将在 2030 年提前实现这个探排放的达风，到 2060 年前要这个实现碳中和。 那实际上很多全球的现在接近 120 几个国家都做出或者是正在考虑做出类似的这个承诺。 那么这个承诺意味着什么呢？ 它可能意味着一个应该说巨大的市场。 我可以举一个例子。
            讲者3：欧盟，是在今年的 2 月份推出了叫做一个绿色复苏的计划。 那这个复苏的计划是完全有这个紧紧围绕着这个如何去减排这个碳排放这个计划有人估算过，大概的这个市场规模或者投资需求将达到这个 1 万亿欧元这么一个水平。 那我们实际上，前两天也做了一个发布了一个报告。 我们认为在中国，你如果要推动零碳转型的话，中国的这个在七个大的领域有十五万亿的这么一个市场规模，到 2050 年，然后会带来这个七十万亿的这么一个投资的这个需求。 所以我是为这个我们一个巨大的市场摆在了面前。
            讲者3：那跟咱们这个通用设备的这个制造报企业有什么关系呢？ 今天我其实自己也没有想得太明白有什么关系。 但今天早上我其实参加了一个对接会，对接会上面有一个企业的老板，就说他的需求是啥？ 他们在这个国外要大量这个锂矿。 因为新能源汽车动力电池的这个需求，所以有大量开采锂矿。 那么需要这个这个我们叫做流程这个设备流体设备。 那么我我简单地做一下估算。 欧盟的这个刚才说的这么一个绿色复苏，它设定的目标是从现在的动力电池汽车，也就是以锂电池为代表的这个动力电池汽车，它的这个消费量或者生产量。 从现在的 200 万辆，它会到 2030 年的 3000 万辆。 那这意味着什么呢？ 它意味着有 7500 万欧元的这么一个市场。 那七篇 500 万欧元。
            讲者3：对于这个需要开采多少一个矿山，这个我没有做具体的计算，但是我认为再往上游走，它会带来巨大的这个市场，给咱们设备制造商带来巨大的市场。 所以我们作为这个我们是一个非盈利组织，我们就是想推动或者加速这个全球的能源转型，为更多的这样的一个市场的形成做出我们的贡献。 所以接下来如果大家感兴趣的话，我愿意跟大家一起交流，我们对这个欧洲，美国的市场，在相关的领域有比较多的比较深入的了解，很研究所以也希望有机会跟大家进一步的交流，谢谢大家。
            讲者4：大家好。 刚才三位嘉宾都已经介绍了三位嘉宾，两位是政府部门的，都是免费给企业提供服务的，有企业也是非盈利的，我唯一是要提供服务要收费的。 我是法国律师事务所的那个一个百能律师事务所的一个律师，看这个照片有点有点，那个有点有点太早了，因为早上早新照片没有来得及换上了。 这个就是我那个二十年前在法国那个成为法国律师宣誓的时候那天拍的照片，然后这次就把这给放上去了。 就是我们作为法国律师事务所，为能给企业带来什么，主要是帮助这个中国企业去法国和欧洲投资提供一些法律的服务。 刚才前面几位嘉宾又介绍了瑞士的英国的一些优势。 法国的优势我就不介绍了。 我主要是介绍一下，就是我们能为企业做什么。 那么。

            讲者1：刘云宇、朱瑞奇以及我们的深夜徐老师。
            讲者1：来请坐来掌声给一下好不好？ 哇这个手机一个一个拿出来了，全部都是自媒体没错了，真的吗？ 你自媒体号是什么？ 你跟我讲一下你个人的微博号好了，不过我们首先先请我的每一位先跟大家来前面拍照的坐下。 喽。 大家好。
            讲者2：中美插画师dq。 喽大家好，我是刘仁宇。
            讲者1：肉肉诶肉。
            讲者1：徐老师你好，徐老师长这样这么漂亮。 终于见到本人了来喽。
            讲者2：大家好，我是作家玛丽老师。
            讲者1：那我们这一类全部都是千禧一代的，这个一大早起来是不是很难过的一件事情。 我想问一下早上 10 点钟开始的，我们这样子落场会不会不知道抱太远。
            讲者2：拥抱能量，没有。
            讲者1：因为我一直觉得说我们的兴趣一般应该都挺爱睡觉的，坐下来都不会就不好。 有那种今天早起来。 那牛肉是你的早起是不是。
            讲者2：我喜欢早上。
            讲者1：起来干什么？ 不知道你在这早上起来可能写词，随着音乐早上会比较有灵感。 我随便说的就是这样子。
            讲者2：早上洗澡的时候也会有。
            讲者1：早上起早的时候，那深夜是老师，你既然是深夜的话，精力一大早，对你来讲是不是一个很困难的一件事？
            讲者2：我年轻的时候也是不会起床，然后我叫事业石老师，但是现在每天要一大早起床拍视频，我的压力让我压弯的压，我就只能早上起床。 生活的压力压花乐园。
            讲者1：没有，因为其实说真的，对于很多我们的年轻一代来进行一代一些女性创作者也好，我们是创业者也好，真正的就像我们阿雅所讲的一样，充满了这种专业的精神。 你看本来深夜现在就是要早晨要起来，因为要开始工作，要开始展示出来自己专业的魅力。 对不对？ 其实我们刚一开始的时候已经找不到，经常会有三个不一样的主题。 首先我们先聊到了就是有关于自我认知还有审美观。 那大家可能会发现到，其实对于具体在来访的话，我们自我认知还有审美观有一个巨改变，非常非常大的改变。 从以前我们都觉得说一定要育女形象，能用起以前对不对？ 一定要用育女形象的一些女明星茶菜谱，但现在又不一样了。 刚才我看了想想，那可能我们从创造运营里面，我们也有个性的岗位，当然还有我们的个性的王菊像这样子就代表出来一个新生世代的一种人生的态度。 管理老师。
            讲者2：他在这件事情我好像我小时候有一句广告词叫我的梦中情人一定要有一头乌黑亮丽的想法，是不是就那个广告好像经常过？ 然后我从小我就我从小我就是短头发，因为其实在想完了就变不了别人的梦中情人，然后就一直都是短头发，因为短头发很好洗，然后一洗就干了。 经常有人跟我说你不可以把头发留长一下，变一下造型吗？ 就算了。 好像现在梦中情人应该有很多种了吧，就不是那么唯一的一种。
            讲者1：所以你其实从小就开始做自己。
            讲者2：就开始 UG 也没有，中间肯定经历了很多波折。 然后到现在就我刚才你年轻的时候是什么时候那种，你应该我年轻的时候一直在看你的文章，真的，特别激动。 我其实也是很年轻的时候开始写的，我没有那么我刚才在听他们说什么 70 后或者我一上台我就要讲一下我是 80 后，因为很多人说听就是看我的文章长大，觉得我可能年纪很大，就没有。
            讲者1：对，其实我们毛利老师他之前做了很多不一样的一些专栏，然后或者是到后面开始写自己的文章，自己的书对不对？ 有很多自己的一些作品，其实里面全部都讲到一些女生世代，一些是又观察到其实现代的女性她们一些自我认知或是审美观的一个改变。
            讲者2：有就以前你你看以前偶像剧里面好像很多女生都是，失恋了就好痛苦。 我就想现在有吗？ 也没有，就是我们现在其实很多女性都是很有自制之你的，就说也不会说你趴一个就是偶像这边经常有什么富二代，然后到你面前开着名车，然后女生就觉得哇我找到幸福了。 但其实我觉得现在大部分的女生看到这样的男生出现在面前，第一反应就是说这个人会不会是骗子这样是不是就是会有自我理解，是已经开始明显是不是就是你不会相信说有那种什么天上掉馅饼，然后那种特别偶像制你放在你面前，你不会一下子就会去相信你不会觉得这就是我从小的梦想，这个我觉得没有。
            讲者2：那我们徐老师你怎么看的这件事情呢？ 我的想法跟你很像。 可能是因为我一直受华为老师的行好看一些独立地主文法。 所以其实刚刚他讲了很多，我觉得现在女生也一样，无论是工作还是感情，大家开始越来越谨慎自己的个性。 因为我们公司也有很多年轻女孩子，刚刚主编在上面说，就是看到大家染头发什么的。 其实我们公司也是就好像一个沙马特家族一样，我经常今天星期一烫它是红色头发，然后星期二来做头发，星期三橙色头皮脱皮嫩呐对，我想承头皮可以承受得住吗？ 但我像这种脱发人，我就要好好的护理我的头发，然后对我们动都不敢动。
            讲者1：是压力变得特别大，因为旁边其实一直都在不断的巨变，对不对？ 其实身为艺人的两位是不是也会有这样子的感觉？
            讲者2：就现在因为可能就是 00 后，对就不允许我们。
            讲者1：他们是我们舞台上面唯一的两位 00 后，让他先对不用害羞，我们，对不惧年轻。 对。
            讲者2：所以公司帮我们染一下头发。
            讲者1：你现在这句话是什么意思？ 是公司不愿意让你们染头发。
            讲者2：是不是就是也是怕伤害。
            讲者1：头皮就是健康。 我这都是假话，我本来是本骗人，真的是假的。
            讲者2：真的是假的，你们觉得真的是假的。
            讲者1：全部都是假的，跟那个飞机也是一样吗？
            讲者2：我是真的。 我跟真的是假发，真的是假话。 然后他们跟我说，我就觉得我不可能会靠着头发来。
            讲者1：这里就也没有个人注册吗？
            讲者2：对，长头发了，我就看到我自己吗？ 我觉得很奇怪。
            讲者1：来这个，但是自己想要有多一些不一样的一些电子造型，对他们出。
            讲者2：有说过长发不好看，他是接的，他是接了之前会难过一段时间。 他现在。
            讲者1：但是我想问一下，当然有这样的桑帅那样子的造型对不对？ 他那个造型其实在国外可能教型不高，会比较像有点那种那种哇塞那种感觉，那种造型会你们是想要尝试的吗？ 会不会推荐。
            讲者2：我觉得任何造型都要去尝试，就是我觉得青春就是你要尝试各种，不然你怎么知道你自己适合哪一种是吧。 而且再加上但是他刚刚说了染头发，我觉得我不敢染了，因为我觉得我再染的话可能之前会有点担心，我觉得很多 00 后或者是说我们千禧一代都会有着这样的困难。 对。
            讲者1：这个是清洗衣带那么早就有这样的困扰吗？
            讲者2：真的你们 90 后真的不害怕掉头发吗？
            讲者1：对，你看他头发多么通顺。
            讲者2：我四个月就要染一次头发，真的我四个月就染，我甚至就是这个月，因为我是染那种绿色的头发，然后洗着洗着就黄了。 然后我就跟我反馈说再来一次。
            讲者1：但是我突然发现说其实在舞台上面唯一正常打色的除了我之外，再就是你是不是你所有的创作图都在你的插画里面吗？ 你可以对。
            讲者2：就是我我创作的那个差，天气就是比较丰富多彩，然后经常有很多不一样的电影。 啦啦啦橙色粉色橙色三维五色。 然后。
            讲者2：所以我觉得中方环境非常的那个。
            讲者1：创作心境。 对，但是这个创作心境没有让你在投稿上面大，我施展一下你的创作，我觉得我需要。
            讲者2：因为面对平时实在太 focus 在创作上面对自己的打扮者非常随意。
            讲者1：因为其实我们可以在很多的一些时长的媒体上面看到我们 DP 的一些作品，它的 DP 的作品其实都是一个色彩非常的缤纷而且非常正能量的一种感觉。 当然我个人是特别的喜欢，那待会如果大家有机会的话可以到旁边来看一下我们的一个跟驸马合作的一些我们的鞋款，对不对？ 待会可以问一下春节您感觉是来自于哪一年的好不好？ 好其实我们接下来大家聊到的就是有关于自我认知还有设定美观。 其实对于我们的毛利老师来讲的话，其实毛利老师因为你的作品大家都非常非常的熟知，所以你可以跟我们讲一下说在你的作品里面所有人物的刻画过程当中，你怎么去把这个审美你不能觉得说你人物的科化的审美或者是那种方向都会随着时间的变迁而有必要的改变。
            讲者2：就是明显我写小说的时候，现在的女主角会比以前的有钱很多，讲得太好了，真实男主角就更有钱。 那我从来没有写过那种很有钱的男主角，觉得就是我觉得很多女性成长过程中可能会一开始就觉得我可能想要找一个很有钱的男朋友，后来会发现让自己有钱比找一个有钱的男朋友又容易得多，来靠谱得多。
            讲者1：对吧？ 而且我觉得说其实现在有很多的女性不管是从作品上面也好，或者是从语气作品上面也好，也有很大的一些不同的改变。 你没有发现到你说哪方面。 我觉得在很多的作品文章里面或者是影视作品商品可以发现到女性其实有很大的一些不一样的话，就像你刚刚所讲的一样，导致我们在看一些偶像剧的时候可能看到的女性嘴唇都是什么傻白甜。
            讲者2：我现在在举着我另一个手机。
            讲者1：然后给大家，但是现在可能会有点痛苦，姚晨在尽量稳一下，这个都挺好。 都挺好。 对里面它就是一个很有自己能量的女性的代表，他也不怕别人黑吗？ 对就是离婚。
            讲者2：包括生活中也是如果你不自己稳准狠的话，就马上就会，因为我们毕竟到现在这个还是有那么一点男权社会，对不对？ 就没有并。

        -  |
            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：我一直非常好奇的就是我们上海嘉定安婷在当时那种全中国人民还不知道亲为何物的时候，为什么在那种混沌状态的话决定做亲能。
            讲者2：其实嘉定青藤岗的前身应该说最早就是上燃动力，应该说这是我们嘉定青藤岗 001 号的一个企业，那也是当时整个嘉定在布局汽车产业的时候。 然后上燃动力作为氢能的第一个企业，在同济大学家庭校区周边，那么在不点。 所以应该说整个家庭亲人岗的发展其实就是从 0 到 1 的时候，就是上人动力。
            讲者1：那接下来的问题就是问我们卢总，卢总是老上汽人了，上汽当年是如何想到要做这件事情，或者说怎样来在那个点上掀起了中国气能风暴呢？
            讲者3：上汽和山南动力在整个 20 年的发展过程中有很多的互动。 整个上海就刚才说几个相关方，同济也好，上汽也好，上南也好，那几个核心人员都在为整个燃料地植整个产业在坚持，在付出，也在奉献。 对。
            讲者1：那么接下来我想我们的车当时做好之后，一定少不了去我们盛华高总那个嘉清站。 嘉清，那毕竟是我们上海第一座嘉清站，也请高层回忆跟我们讲一下这个历史。
            讲者4：我回顾就是这个历史，我们从现在的那个相似物流处这个 8.5 米的这个物流车，我们用这么小的车子来做一辆移动驾轻车，然后再做到了用那个牵引车来拖的这样子大的那个移动加急车，然后再来见那个安田嘉兴站。 那么安田嘉兴站实际上当时都没有标准，也是在这个基础上面，我们产生了国内第一个地标上海市燃料地电子汽车加清站的那个规范。 所以这个过程应该说确实也是起伏很大，碰到了很多问题。
            讲者1：为什么上燃能够有 20 年的历史？ 在当时大家都不知道亲为何物，今天大家觉得亲如此之热，是因为有这么一批优秀的伙伴。 那么接下来天一组你作为尚然今年 20 年的传承人是怎样想？ 氢能是一条很庞杂繁复的很长。
            讲者5：长的产业链一定是需要产业链各个环节大家一起去共创，来推动这个产业链的商业化。 所以说未来尚然会怎么做，尚然会敞开怀抱，和行业内每一个优质的企业探讨合作的方式。 我们一起来把这个产业在打赢中国的基础上走向全球。
            讲者1：只有重型才能行得远。 我们愿意跟我们企在座的所有企业家，包括现在在线上的各位所有的嘉宾，一起优秀的企业家，一起把中国氢能人他奋斗了 20 年的这个劲传达出来，然后咱们一起去做更多更大的市场，我觉得这个才是我们中心承办这场活动的本意。 那么接下来介绍的陈魏总希望说您作为一个观察者做资源的方，你如何看中国情冷这二十年呢？
            讲者6：从我旁观者的角度来观察我们中国的这个氢能行业的发展的话，我想用两个词来形容，一个叫困难重重，第二个叫精彩非凡。 困难重重体现在两个方面，第一个是技术，当时的说法是全世界的博都给你用都不够，你用在天蓝的电子车上，这是在技术层面上，在市场层面上，当时也不存在非常好的应用亲人的市场。 从我们资源的角度来看，大家不用担心资源的匮乏，资源永远都是一个话题，我们一定会来满足这个资源方面的要求。 资源永远一开始是一个问题，但它到了最后一般都会被证明它不是一个问题。
            讲者1：我非常认可陈总的观点，就是所有玩能源一定要看资源。 好了。 那么接着话筒又回到那个我们邱主任这里，邱主任刚才讲了如何当时是开闭鸿蒙了。 那么就说现在和将来的话我们嘉定是包括我们安婷是怎么考虑说继续发展倾呢？
            讲者2：实际上发展氢能的话应该是一个漫长的道路。 那么今天的家庭氢能岗已经主要从两个大方面和三个平台构建了两个方面，第一个是在科创平台这个方面，第二步叫汽车先锋，实际上就是从科创到汽车，我们首先在这几年做了两个大的方面的一的布局。 那么从其实三个平台主要是在技术的平台上，还有场景的应用释放。 当然第三个是我们在这个产业生态上面，这为我们整个后续的一个进行新一轮的一个升级，为产业化方面打下了一个良好的基础。
            讲者1：我们还是在这个继续深耕发芽，是继续接着准备开更大的果实。 卢总也注意到了，邱主任说，其实嘉定是因车而起义决定做氢能。 那您作为优秀的上汽人，现在有直接负责上汽的氢能部门，您是怎么看现在的氢能和未来？
            讲者3：我觉得氢能现在应该说是一个最好的时刻，就也等于是天刚刚亮还有没有量的时候。 我个人认为就是第一波的拐点会在 2025 年左右，到那个时候就也等于是加心账更完备了，加清的成本也更低了。 另外就是整个硬件的成本也更便宜了。 等到下个拐点，我觉得会是在 2028 年到 2030 年，到那个时候这也就意味着燃料电池硬件的技术水平更高，功率密度更大，性能更好，成本更低，亲戚获得性更方便，成本更低。 所以我个人认为这个行业会越走越宽。 并且整个随着生态圈里的所有的相关方的共同努力下，我们国内的燃料电池完全会复制锂电池的辉煌。
            讲者1：其实卢总很谦虚，我知道你是在怎么样的降本的，你的万辆燃料电池汽车的这个布局都已经推出来了，这布局非常深远。 那我们高总，我们的嘉兴站能不能行，对，现在这么多将近小十万辆燃料电池汽车会在三四年之内急剧爆发，那我们基础设施是否跟得上呢？
            讲者4：这个问题确实还是我觉得蛮难回答的。 所谓难回答就是说现在感觉到那个新的基础设施我们现在主要是指嘉兴站，嘉兴山在发展过程当中碰到的问题还是蛮多的。 首先一个还是我们这个规划土地的问题。 第二个现在就是实际上跟前面的问题是相关的，就是现在建交基站的投资还是很大，特别涉及到土地。 应该说影响很大。 但是说到基础设施，我个人认为现在清冷的发展，首先的出发点是燃料电子汽车的技术的进步。 这下就是要畅想一下，就是说在 2060 年已经实现碳中和了，那个时候的 AI 结构是怎么样的？ 这个假如说我们现在能够有谁有先知先觉得能够把它定下来，那我觉得我们的技术路线也定了，我们的基础设施发展的那个，所有的相关的东西都解决了。 所以在这里我也非常希望我们的各位专家也有机会给我们也头脑风暴提供一些很有价值的一个建议。
            讲者1：嘉兴站基础设施的顶层规划尽快出来。 那接着又话筒到了天翼总这里，您认为说像上然它现在和未来它的考虑是什么？ 会单一的发动机吗？ 还是多场景的区域使用这个东西？ 氢能的应用。
            讲者5：还是多场景？ 对于尚然来说，未来我们的方向在中短期是十分明确的，更多的不是应用，而是产品应用是为了支撑产品的成熟度提升，随着产品成熟度提升，进一步来扩展应用的领域。 所以这也是我们当前定义下来企业的这样一个基础基调和未来的方向。
            讲者1：当然未来决定从其他行业的降碳这么一个背景下，通过它的应用来拉动我产品，我觉得也不是一种非常聪明的生存策略。 那么这又到了陈威总这里，您觉得资源上从现在到未来会怎样呢？ 你们会不会注入更多的关注力？ 在中国。
            讲者6：从我们的角度来看，这个资源的问题实际上可以有三个角度去思考。 第一个技术永远是帮助解决资源问题的一个最核心的一个方面。 通过这个技术的进步，可以使我们有限的资源可以发挥出它最大的效益。 这是第一个。 第二个我们觉得活细贵金属它是一个特别的商品，严格意义上来说它是不灭的，换句话来说它是可以回收的。 那么我们相信到了那一天，所有的跟氢能相关的跟薄熙就是有关的应用也会进入一个回收。 所以这个是第二个思考的角度。 第三个思考的角度。 我相信大家也意识到了，剥削贵金属这东西，你在使用它什么？ 因为它的本身的物质在使用的过程当中几乎是不灭尸的，所以你使用它的是什么时间价值？ 所以总体来讲的话，从目前供应量没有变的情况下，我们可以有这三个思考。 当然我可以告诉大家这个资源是极其丰富的，但是从我们今天的角度来看的话，我是建议大家从我们前面提到的三个思考的方向来考虑如何在一定的阶段里面保证我们这个资源的安全性跟稳定性。 石总讲这个让我就突然很安心。
            讲者1：好，那接着我们就用一句话总结一下，对于未来氢能怎么看。
            讲者2：我觉得就说未来我们家庭氢能岗是叫以轻易叹布局全方位的这个氢能的产业链和技术链，为中国的氢能筑上更多的发展。
            讲者3：氢能整个大产业，那个光前景很光明，但道路肯定是充满曲折的。 所以说征途漫漫，所有同人唯有奋斗。
            讲者4：我们已经看到了那个亲人发展的曙光。 一起努力，相信轻视中介能源这句话。
            讲者5：20 年前我们在国内奋斗，在这个交通和能源变革的窗口期，我们希望 20 年之后，我们在国际这个平台上奋斗。
            讲者6：在我们双碳的战略的背景下，氢能它作为一个脱探的栋梁，那亲人是义不容辞的。
            讲者1：那今天咱们的这个座谈环节就到这里，谢谢。

            会议总结：

            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：再次感谢三位老师带来的精彩分享。 那下面我们进入互动提问环节，那待会我们就请三位老师上台，请大家踊跃提问。
            讲者1：那线下的同学有什么问题吗？ 可以举手。
            讲者2：我有两个问题想问一下。 然后第一个问题就是就是这关于这张黑洞照片的，就是我听薛老师第一篇那个讲的时候他讲就是说比较就是他观测比较多的是那个，因为他好像是微波波段，然后他的观测会比较明显一点。 然后但是这张照片它明显就是就包括后来说的红外或者 S 车线观测。 但是这张我们能看到这张片是因为它可能是可见光波段。 那为什么他其实主要不是在可见光波段拍摄，我们却能看到这张照片呢？ 这是第一个问题，谢谢。 我先回答你第一。
            讲者3：这个问题就是可见观波段是做不到的。 因为我们在银河系盘面上有特别多的尘埃物质，就说它的销冠特别厉害。 从银河系中心发的官学波那种官职到我们这边销官是 30 个新的，或者说是大概几十亿个官学波段的官字只有一个有概率能到达地球上被我们看到。 所以官学波段是没有任何可能性可以看到银河系中心的。 所以最起码你得到像那个就是 20 年的那个诺贝尔奖，就是观测那个闹着银河系中心黑洞闹转恒星的那个，已经是在 K 波段，在两微米的波长还可以，所以毫米波波段就更没有问题的。 还有射电波段也没有问题。  X 射线波段因为它穿光子穿透能力很强，所以说也没问题能看得到，但官学跟那个紫外波段是没有可能性的。
            讲者4：我觉得那个另外我补充一点就是这位同学可能是好奇的是，为什么？ 既然是不是我们可见光波段，为什么还能看得到这么一个照片是吧？ 这个一般情况下，在我们天文大多数不可见的东西，我们都会有一个标准的类似一个翻译样子，把它翻译到我们可见的就是这种可视化的一个过程。 否则的话你你咱们不可能放一个东西，我是说这也有一张照片，然后你看的全是白的是吧。
            讲者3：那你可以把它播成映射到可见观波段，这样我们就能看到了。 对，这个就是就像我们 X 射线拍的照片，我们人眼是看不到 X 射线的，但是我告诉你，这是圈出来 X 射线太空眼镜拍的照片，这个天体的照片很漂亮，这都是做的那个关子能量把它映射到比如说这个 0.5 到 2 KTV 我把它映射到红色，2到比如说 2 到 4 KTV 我就把它映射到绿色，然后 6 到 8 KV 映射到红色，这样子我们就可以产生一个假颜色。 图。
            讲者5：我再补充一下。 就这张图，它观测就是 1.3  毫米 230g 赫兹，它没有别的频段，它这个颜色是代表了它的这个亮度。 他一般看这个图的。 其实你仔细下面有一个颜色条，这个颜色条比方说有多亮。 对比对应了这个俯视光度是多少。 多按就就它它是它颜色条代表了一个物理量，代表了你的这些辐射强度，或者我们干脆就代表用温度来表示由温度代表这个粒子的能量，能量在能量越高的话，它辐射就越强。 所以说它实际上是 1.3  毫米的 1.3  我们是看不见的，它只是告诉你我用 1.3  毫米接收到的它在不同的地方来的这个辐射强度的分布大概这样。

            会议总结：

            下面有一段会议记录，请你阅读后，写一段总结，总结会议的内容。
            会议记录：
            讲者1：我们就反过来说，哪几个是不大好的。 我们高高在上的弃执意识的自以为是的，我觉得对我们的心理治疗这个事业是最大的损伤。 这个当然，如果我们这里面还有一个把自己的不良的我制定不良是打引号的，这指的是不符合我们社会主流的价值观，带到我们心理制度的过程当中，这是不良的没有界限的。 比方说我们根本就没有一个基本的治疗的设置，没有伦理的这个意识的是最糟糕的，我们这样的治疗师还不如什么的。 没有如果说三五个，我就列出这几条。
            讲者2：我觉得李老师是刚才讲的这些我就不讲了，因为我觉得很重要。 那个我只是特别想回应一点，就是希望通过心理咨询和治疗来获得权利的人，那是非常可怕的。 这个甚至他比要获得金钱的人更可怕，我觉得这是一个这个重点啊。 啊当然只是通过获得，因为希望通过心理咨询的治疗来报复的人。 我觉得主要是因为他估计很快自己就就离开这个行业了。 但是有很多想通过心理咨询的治疗获得权利，我觉得这是很糟糕的一种做法。 那我想正面的角度来讲。 我个人觉得有一些基本的就不再讲了，我觉得可能有两点。 除了我刚才讲到的慈悲之外，有一个就是对人有好奇心就是我觉得这是非常非常重要的，就是对这个人不是对他的学历物或者怎么，而是这个人对他内在世界友好奇心。
            讲者2：我觉得如果说没有这样的一个特点的话，我觉得他成为不了一个非常好的心理咨询和治疗师，同样他在这个心理咨询和治疗当中也没有办法获得一种能在价值层面上的满足，所以我觉得这是一个重要的特点第二个部分，我觉得是一种怎么讲就是能够当另外一个人类的同伴在你面前我觉得还是可以说是一个你能够为给予他一点支持或者帮助而感到在价值层面上的满足，我觉得这是重要。 这样的话，你你在住人的时候，你始终会觉得这是一件对你来说重要的事情。 所以你也可以把总结为助人的这个价值观是放在自己核心价值观的前几位的。 所以我想就讲这两个。
            讲者3：因为我想到就是我们刚才因为您用的词是恰当的。 恰当的品质其实它不一定是优秀的品质，但它应该是恰当的，它应该是有胜任的。 然后我就想起我们以前老说的关于咨询师的胜任力模型的那三个三个维度，我觉得恰当的他应该是要有你你得有基本的知识吧是吧。 你对于心理咨询的知识，对于人理解的知识啊对于伦理的知识，你得有恰当的技能吧。 啊你能共情啊，你能够去跟他提问呐，你能够去理解解他。 同时你应该要有一个恰当的态度。
            讲者3：这个恰当的态度我很喜欢科普特的一句话，就是不带诱惑的深情，不带一一的拒绝。 我觉得有些时候我们是要有这样的工作，就是不带诱惑的深情，就是你对这个人你是我觉得所有的助人行业都首先应该是爱人的，你的也是有爱人之心的。 那这种爱人之心它不是带着诱惑的，其实就是关于伦理的部分。 同时它还有一后半句话是不带敌意的。 拒绝不太第一的拒绝。 其实他主要跟我们讲的是边界的问题，就是我们咨询师是要守住我们的底线，守住我们的边界的。
            讲者2：我觉得实际上这个问题实际上不仅仅取决还是两个方面，一个是你的个人选择。 另外就是环境我记得在我当时授训的时候，那么除了课程之外，唯一的有系统的长城培训，只有精神分析动力学或者只有我在那个时候只知道有精神分析动力学，所以就是没有什么好选择的如果我想接受继续的长城培训，我可能就是从这边起家。 现在我觉得我们国家现在已经不仅仅只是好单一流派一统天下的局面了。 我想从 CBT 从系统家庭从这个动力学，至少这三大流派都有比较成熟的这样的培训体系了。 所以我觉得在这个角度来说，至少在你的可选择的这种选项上面已经不像当年那么的有限，或者说我们讲到的，而且还有各种各样的补充培训。 对吧，网上，上的线下的，中德的这个品牌的以及其他品牌的都有。 所以我想还是要回到一个人格的问题，人有特点的问题我也讲过。
            讲者2：其实各大流派我喜欢做的一个比喻是套餐，就是它是你是个套餐，就是动力学，不仅仅只是讲自由联想，讲诠释。 那他其实背后是有他对于人性的这个假设的，你会看李小思老师讲的那一些包括语言，包括直觉，包括节制包括中立的一些态度，这都是套餐里面的。 那换句话来讲，我觉得作为动力学的动力学的这个取向来讲是对于人的内在世界，尤其是潜意识的过程保持一个非常大的重视。 而认知行为从这个角度上来讲就不太一样了。 如果你去追溯到他这个苏格拉底的这样子的一个哲学的渊源的话，他认为实际上人跟人之间可以通过不断地对话，然后不断地去辩论来澄清一体。 就我觉得这些不同，我们的这个价值观这个问题我也不晓展开很多。 我只是说就是如果说你对自己的人性观价值观，对于觉得为什么人会有痛苦以及什么样的人，什么样的生活是值得过的。
            讲者2：你有大概的一套想法，一套理念，我觉得你可以确实我觉得最简单的是从一个跟你的理念比较像的学派开始学起。 然后学到一定程度也许你觉得学得差不多了那你又能够开放到发现其实人生还有其他的可能性，这个时候你可以再去学其他的优化，当然这是非常理想的。 好。 这个是天时地利人，但是我想至少是一个我历年当中比较理想的这个状况。 那最后我想分享一点，我觉得我自己就是最初的理论的这个取向是精神分析动力学，那么它一直都是我一个非常底色的这个取向。 但是后来慢慢的我这个学的行为学了像催眠的治疗学、拉里克森的学派，所以他会在我的底色上面加加一些不同的色彩。 所以说我想我比五年前 10 年前可能会相对来说更灵活相对来说更多的。 有的时候可能从外在来讲可能有点放低标准好不再追求那种这种启蒙式的高远理想。 而是就是哼好像有点没出息，就是活着就好，你先得活下去，然后再看好。 但是如果你再反过来，可能我这个底色骨子里面仍然是有动力学的价值观在的。 所以我想也用一些。 第一是直接回答这位同行的问题。 另外我想也回应一下我个人的一些体验，希望对你有所启发，谢谢。
            讲者3：我觉得刚才高老师的回应可能也正好回应了这个同行的问题。 我觉得可能在我们一开始，对于到底学什么样的一个流派，我们总是会很纠结。 那这种纠结其实如果说我们反过来看，就是我们回到第一个问题，最后我们会看到，什么样的流派会对来访者更加起效的话，那其实这个纠结可能就没有了。 心理学中有一个比较有名的效应叫渡渡鸟效应。 它就是说我们所有的流派最后其实起效是差不多的，他没有哪个流派就明显的好于哪个流派，人本和经验分析都是我自己也蛮喜欢的两个不同的流派，但说他们不同，其实很多时候他们又有很多共同的部分。 以前我导师老师说他是精神分析学界就是最懂人本的，在人本来懂精神分析的。 所以其实这么个讲法其实也是代表我们心理咨询。 我觉得刚才李晓斯老师讲的那八注是最重要的，就那些可能是一个基础，就这个基础无论是哪个流派，流派的咨询师都应该要具备的重要的个人特质。
            讲者3：那么关于我们最后学决定学哪个呢？ 一个是在于机会。 刚才甘老师说了，他在的年代就只有精神动力学，精神分析，就没得学。 好了，我们就直接学这个就得了。 那如果是你有更多的机会的时候，那你看看哪个的人性，光你可能还是跟你的价值观跟你的人际观更接近。 你发现两个都很好，你都喜欢，那就慢慢学看哪个价格更适合你你就是有很多现实的环境的因素可能也会决定我们最后学哪个流派。 谢谢这个伙伴的提问。 这个可能现在是纠结的，但我想过个三年，再过个五年，你可能就没那么纠结了。
            讲者1：首先我们大家内部有一个自我叫什么呢？ 自嘲的一种说法，说我们都就是学习型人格障碍患者。 那我觉得这话值得深思。 如果一个人不是在学习，就是在学习的路上学了十几种二十几种的疗法，我觉得真要值得反思了。 大家要知道，如果说指望我什么东西得学好，然后就觉得超人一等，这是一种病态的想法。 我也告诉大家这是一种妄想，为什么现在心理治疗的流派几百种，甚至达到上千种？ 你去学。 还有我们指望十八般武艺样样精通，然后指望我们在华山论剑，一战成云。 妄想。 我的建议是什么？ 踏踏实实的先学好几门基础的。 刚才我们高静老师还有佳璐都说的这个事，我觉得大家至于从哪一门开始是认知行为的、家庭治疗的、人本的，还是精神分析的，我觉得都不要紧。 但是至少我先学个精把力门学好之后再来和其他的几个流派比较，不要在今天东一榔头西一棒，这样下去，你别说是 80 万，我看你去八百万都不够的。 同志们没有这个必要，先学好几门几种。 我刚才建议这四种，你们任选一门，学好以后再学其他的，这是我给大家的忠告。

            会议总结：
