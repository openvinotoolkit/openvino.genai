{"text": "The commercial PC market is propelled by premium computing solutions that drive user productivity and help service organizations protect and maintain devices. Corporations must empower mobile and hybrid workers while extracting value from artificial intelligence (AI) to improve business outcomes. Moreover, both public and private sectors must address sustainability initiatives pertaining to the full life cycle of computing fleets. An inflection point in computing architecture is needed to stay ahead of evolving requirements. Introducing Intel® Core™ Ultra Processors Intel® Core™ Ultra processors shape the future of commercial computing in four major ways: Power Efficiency The new product line features a holistic approach to powerefficiency that benefits mobile work. Substantial changes to the microarchitecture, manufacturing process, packaging technology, and power management software result in up to 40% lower processor power consumption for modern tasks such as video conferencing with a virtual camera.  Artificial Intelligence Intel Core Ultra processors incorporate an AI-optimized architecture that supports new user experiences and the next wave of commercial applications. The CPU, GPU, and the new neural processing unit (NPU) are all capable of executing AI tasks as directed by application developers. For example, elevated mobile collaboration is possible with support for AI assisted background blur, noise suppression, eye tracking, and picture framing. Intel Core Ultra processors are capable of up to 2.5x the AI inference performance per watt as compared to Intel’s previous mobile processor offering."}
