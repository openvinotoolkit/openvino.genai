1. See [pull_request_template.md](./pull_request_template.md) for pull request (PR) requirements.
2. See [BUILD.md](./src/docs/BUILD.md) for instructions on how to build OpenVINOâ„¢ GenAI.
3. Code style is determined by the file the change is made in. If ambiguous, look into the neighboring files of the same type. In case of contradiction, pick any of the options but stay consistent in your choice.
4. Don't push to the upstream repository (https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/). After the branch is pushed to the upstream, non-admins can't push to it. That results in contributors being unable to refine their changes. Instead, create your fork and open your PR from there to the upstream.
5. Your PR will be tested after one of the developers approves the tests run.
6. See [OpenVINO's guide](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino/blob/71ee9cc42ec63b3affb2801dbbc4a77e6d8003f6/CONTRIBUTING_PR.md#branching-policy) for branching policy.
